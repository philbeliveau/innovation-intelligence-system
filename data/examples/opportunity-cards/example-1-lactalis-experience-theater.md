# Transform Routine Consumption Into Brand Theater

## Description

The Savannah Bananas reimagined baseball by prioritizing entertainment over traditional sport conventions. Their "Fans First" philosophy transforms every game into a theatrical experience with choreographed celebrations, audience participation, and unconventional rules designed for engagement rather than competitive purity. This approach has created a sold-out phenomenon with 2+ million people on waiting lists, demonstrating that experience design can overcome commodity perception.

For Lactalis Canada, this approach offers a blueprint for transforming routine dairy consumption into memorable brand experiences. As consumers increasingly value experiences over products—with 78% of millennials preferring to spend money on experiences rather than things—there's an opportunity to create "Cheese Tasting Theater" events that combine product education with entertainment. These events would turn cheese selection from a commodity purchase into a cultural experience, similar to wine tasting but with theatrical elements.

This aligns with Lactalis' premium positioning and addresses the strategic challenge of differentiating in a crowded dairy market where price competition dominates. By creating shareable, Instagram-worthy moments around cheese discovery, Lactalis can build emotional connections with younger urban consumers while justifying premium pricing through experiential value. The approach transforms marketing spend from interruptive advertising to invitation-only brand experiences that generate organic social amplification.

## Actionability

- **Marketing Team:** Conduct 3-5 customer interviews with millennials/Gen Z cheese buyers in Toronto and Montreal to validate interest in experiential cheese events, gauging willingness-to-pay and preferred event formats (2 weeks)
- **Product Team:** Design pilot "Cheese Tasting Theater" event concept (90 minutes, 40-50 attendees) with entertainment elements including host personality, interactive challenges, and storytelling; identify 2-3 potential venue partners in Toronto (4 weeks)
- **Brand Strategy:** Benchmark 5-10 competitor experiential marketing initiatives (Lululemon community events, Sephora beauty classes, craft brewery taproom experiences) and develop ROI model comparing cost-per-engaged-consumer for events vs. traditional advertising (3 weeks)
- **Digital Team:** Create social media content strategy for event amplification, including influencer partnership criteria, user-generated content prompts, and paid amplification budget recommendations (2 weeks)
- **Finance:** Develop business case with three scenarios (break-even on ticket sales, 50% subsidy, 100% subsidy) projecting brand lift, customer acquisition cost, and lifetime value impact compared to traditional channels (3 weeks)

## Visual

*Imagine a dimly lit industrial-chic venue with exposed brick walls and a small elevated stage. A charismatic host—part sommelier, part comedian—theatrically presents five artisan cheeses on a wooden board, using dramatic lighting and music cues for each reveal. The audience of 40 young professionals (ages 25-40) sits at communal tables, each person with a custom tasting paddle featuring Lactalis branding etched subtly into bamboo. Between tastings, the audience participates in a "blind taste challenge" with prizes, laughing as they debate flavor notes. Soft Edison bulbs create warm ambient lighting while a photographer captures candid moments. Lactalis branding appears elegantly on tasting cards, glassware, and a vintage-style poster behind the stage, creating an upscale-yet-approachable atmosphere that feels more like a secret supper club than a corporate event.*

## Follow-up Prompts

1. **Validation:** How might we test whether millennials and Gen Z consumers perceive experiential cheese events as premium brand building vs. gimmicky marketing, and what signals in the pilot would indicate authentic engagement vs. novelty-seeking behavior that doesn't translate to purchase intent?

2. **Expansion:** What other "routine consumption categories" within Lactalis' portfolio (yogurt, butter, milk, cream) could benefit from the experiential approach, and how would the entertainment format need to differ for each category to maintain authenticity while avoiding repetitive brand experiences?

3. **Challenge:** How might we overcome the fundamental constraint that physical experiences don't scale like digital marketing (limited to 40-50 people per event vs. millions of impressions), and what hybrid physical-digital formats could amplify reach while preserving the core experiential value that justifies premium positioning?
