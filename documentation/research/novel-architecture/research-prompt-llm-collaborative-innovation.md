# Research Prompt: Can LLMs Collaboratively Generate Innovative Ideas?

**Research Date:** 2025-10-08
**Project:** Innovation Intelligence System - Technical Feasibility Validation
**Researcher:** Philippe Beliveau
**Status:** Active Research Phase

---

## Research Objective

**Validate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can collaboratively generate truly innovative ideas** that would be valuable to innovation teams at large CPG companies, specifically examining if LLM-based systems can go beyond data aggregation to produce "freshly baked" innovation opportunities with genuine novelty and actionability.

## Background Context

You're in the early validation phase of an **Innovation Intelligence System** for CPG innovation teams. The core hypothesis is that an AI system can process market signals and generate brand-specific innovation opportunities (5-10 ideas on regular cadence) that are more actionable than raw trend reports. Critical validation questions include:

- Can LLMs generate ideas with sufficient novelty and quality?
- What makes LLM-generated ideas valuable vs. just summarizing existing information?
- Can collaborative/multi-agent LLM approaches produce better innovation outputs?
- Is this defensible beyond prompt engineering?

---

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **What evidence exists that LLMs can generate novel, creative ideas** beyond recombining existing information? (Distinction between retrieval/summarization vs. genuine ideation)

2. **How do collaborative/multi-agent LLM systems compare to single-LLM approaches** for innovation generation? (Evidence for multi-perspective, multi-agent architectures)

3. **What methodologies/frameworks have been validated for LLM-based innovation generation?** (TRIZ, SIT, biomimicry, analogical reasoning applied via LLMs)

4. **How is "innovativeness" or "creativity" measured in LLM-generated ideas?** (Evaluation frameworks, metrics, validation approaches)

5. **What are the documented limitations of LLMs for innovation/ideation?** (Hallucination, lack of domain expertise, inability to assess feasibility, repetitiveness)

6. **How do human-AI collaborative innovation processes perform vs. human-only or AI-only?** (Evidence for augmentation vs. replacement)

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

7. What specific innovation domains have been studied (product design, business models, R&D, etc.)?

8. How do LLMs perform at cross-domain knowledge transfer and analogical reasoning?

9. What role does prompt engineering vs. system architecture play in idea quality?

10. Are there examples of commercial LLM-based innovation tools and their effectiveness?

11. What psychological frameworks have been integrated with LLMs for validation of generated ideas?

12. How do different LLM architectures (GPT-4, Claude, specialized models) compare for creative ideation?

## Success Criteria

This research will be successful if it provides clear answers to:

1. ✅ **Technical Feasibility**: Strong evidence that LLMs can generate innovative ideas (not just summarize)
2. ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Evidence supporting/refuting multi-agent collaborative approaches
3. ✅ **Differentiation**: Understanding what makes LLM innovation valuable vs. existing tools
4. ✅ **Risk Assessment**: Clear understanding of limitations and failure modes
5. ✅ **Competitive Positioning**: Knowledge of existing academic/commercial approaches

**Decision Framework:**
- **Strong Evidence for LLM Innovation** → Proceed with confidence, focus on implementation details
- **Conditional Evidence** → Identify specific conditions/architectures that work, build accordingly
- **Weak Evidence** → Pivot to LLM as research assistant rather than idea generator
- **Evidence for Human-AI Hybrid** → Design system emphasizing collaboration over automation
