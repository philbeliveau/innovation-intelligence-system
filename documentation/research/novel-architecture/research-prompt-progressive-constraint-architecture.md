# Deep Research Prompt: Progressive Constraint-Based Multi-Agent Architectures

## Primary Research Question

Has anyone developed, tested, or published research on **progressive constraint-based multi-agent reasoning architectures** where:
1. Agents operate sequentially rather than in parallel
2. Each reasoning step dynamically constrains the exploration space for subsequent steps
3. Genealogical/provenance tracking is used as structural information (not just metadata)
4. Small-leap incremental reasoning is used to maintain coherence and feasibility

## What Would Constitute "Already Done"

### Strong evidence this exists:

✓ **System explicitly using:**
- Sequential multi-agent reasoning with constraint propagation from stage N to N+1
- Genealogical tracking affecting reasoning validity (not just logging)
- Small-leap architecture designed to maintain feasibility
- Empirical comparison showing sequential constraint-based > parallel synthesis

✓ **Published research directly comparing:**
- Sequential constraint-propagating agents vs. parallel agents
- Reasoning topology impact on coherence/feasibility
- Progressive vs. batch synthesis architectures

✓ **Framework specifically designed for:**
- Progressive context-constrained generation
- Constraint inheritance between reasoning stages
- Provenance-aware multi-agent reasoning

### What does NOT count as "already done":

✗ **Standard sequential agents without constraint propagation:**
- Pipeline architectures where agents just pass outputs forward
- No explicit constraint flow or dynamic boundary adjustment

✗ **Provenance as metadata only:**
- Logging/tracking without affecting reasoning validity
- Audit trails that don't influence agent behavior

✗ **Parallel agents with synthesis:**
- Standard multi-agent frameworks
- Independent agents combined at the end

✗ **Single-agent iterative refinement:**
- One LLM refining its own output
- Not multi-agent with specialized roles

## Key Distinctions to Look For

### Our Approach vs. Similar Work

| Aspect | Our Progressive Architecture | Might Be Confused With |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Constraint flow** | Dynamic propagation shaping exploration space | Static constraints applied uniformly |
| **Genealogy** | Structural information affecting validity | Audit logs/metadata only |
| **Sequentiality** | Each stage inherits constraints from prior | Pipeline passing full outputs forward |
| **Small leaps** | Bounded exploration at each step | Unconstrained generation then filtering |
| **Backtracking** | Intelligent rollback to valid constraint states | Simple retry or regeneration |
| **State management** | Provenance-aware context aggregation | Flat context concatenation |

### Questions to Ask About Each System Found

1. **Do agents operate sequentially with constraint inheritance?**
   - Or do they work in parallel and synthesize?

2. **Is genealogical information structural or just metadata?**
   - Does provenance affect downstream reasoning validity?

3. **Are exploration boundaries dynamic based on prior reasoning?**
   - Or are constraints static across all stages?

4. **Is there explicit comparison of sequential vs. parallel topology?**
   - Do they claim topology matters for output quality?

5. **Does the system maintain coherence through progressive synthesis?**
   - Or through post-hoc filtering/validation?

6. **Is backtracking based on constraint violations?**
   - Or just random retry?

## Expected Findings & Interpretation

### Likely scenario: Partial overlap

**You'll probably find:**
- Sequential agent pipelines (but without constraint propagation)
- Reasoning graphs with provenance (but as metadata, not structural)
- Constraint satisfaction in planning (but not for generative multi-agent)
- Iterative refinement systems (but single-agent, not multi-agent)

**The novelty question becomes:**
Has anyone **combined all these elements** into a progressive constraint-based multi-agent architecture and **empirically demonstrated** it outperforms parallel synthesis?

### How to interpret findings:

**If you find close matches:**
- Identify exact differences from your approach
- Position as "extending [System X] with [novel component Y]"
- Focus on empirical validation they haven't done

**If you find partial matches:**
- "Building on [sequential agents] + [constraint reasoning] + [reasoning graphs]"
- Emphasize novel integration and comparative evaluation

**If you find nothing close:**
- "Surprisingly, despite extensive work on multi-agent systems, constraint reasoning, and sequential reasoning, no prior work has investigated progressive constraint-based architectures for multi-agent generation"
- Strong novelty claim with comprehensive literature review as evidence
