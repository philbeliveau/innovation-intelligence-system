## Progressive Context-Constrained Reasoning: A Novel Multi-Agent Architecture

**Prepared for:** R&D Grant Application (IT Architecture Track)
**Contact:** Philippe Béliveau
**Date:** January 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal investigates **whether reasoning architecture topology fundamentally affects output quality in complex generative tasks**, independent of prompting strategies, model selection, or fine-tuning approaches.

**Core Research Question:**
Do progressive context-constrained multi-agent architectures produce more coherent, feasible, and implementable outputs than parallel synthesis architectures—and can these architectural principles generalize across domains (innovation, medical diagnosis, legal reasoning, scientific hypothesis generation)?

**Novel IT Contribution:**
Development and validation of a new class of multi-agent architectures based on **incremental constraint propagation** and **genealogical reasoning**, advancing the field of distributed AI systems beyond current parallel/hierarchical paradigms.

**Test Domain:** Innovation intelligence (selected for measurable feasibility metrics, not as the research focus)

## 1. The Architectural Research Hypothesis

### 1.1 Problem Statement: Parallel Multi-Agent Limitations

**Current state-of-the-art multi-agent architectures:**
- Agents operate in parallel on decomposed sub-problems
- Synthesis layer combines independent outputs
- Minimal inter-agent constraint propagation
- Limited semantic coherence maintenance across reasoning chains

**Documented limitations:**
- High redundancy in parallel agent outputs (Meincke et al., 2024 - Wharton)
- Coherence degradation in complex multi-step reasoning
- Feasibility deficits when synthesizing independent perspectives
- State explosion in long-context reasoning tasks

### 1.2 Proposed Alternative: Progressive Context-Constrained Architecture

**Core architectural principles:**

1. **Sequential constraint propagation:** Each reasoning step dynamically constrains the exploration space for subsequent steps
2. **Genealogical state tracking:** Explicit lineage maintenance showing how conclusions evolved from prior reasoning
3. **Incremental context aggregation:** Progressive synthesis that maintains semantic coherence through constraint inheritance
4. **Small-leap reasoning chains:** Bounded exploration at each step prevents large semantic jumps that compromise feasibility

**Hypothesis:**
Progressive constraint propagation produces outputs with higher coherence, feasibility, and implementability than parallel synthesis—measurable through domain-independent metrics.

## 2. Novel IT Architecture Components

### 2.1 Research Area #1: Constraint Flow Architecture

**Research question:** How do reasoning constraints propagate through multi-agent systems without over-constraining creative exploration?

**Technical innovations to develop:**

1. **Dynamic constraint boundaries:**
   - Adaptive exploration radius based on prior reasoning confidence
   - Constraint relaxation mechanisms when chains reach dead-ends
   - Multi-dimensional constraint vectors (semantic, feasibility, context)

2. **Constraint inheritance protocols:**
   - State propagation methods between reasoning stages
   - Conflict resolution when new constraints contradict inherited ones
   - Constraint decay functions for long reasoning chains

3. **Backtracking architectures:**
   - Intelligent rollback to valid constraint states
   - Branch-point identification for alternative exploration paths
   - Computational cost-benefit analysis for backtracking vs. restarting

**Generalizable contribution:** Constraint flow protocols applicable to any multi-step reasoning domain.

### 2.2 Research Area #2: Genealogical State Management

**Research question:** How do we maintain idea provenance as structural information that affects reasoning validity, not just metadata?

**Technical innovations to develop:**

1. **Reasoning lineage graphs:**

   - Validation checks against reasoning ancestry
   - Confidence adjustment based on lineage depth and branching

**Generalizable contribution:** Provenance tracking systems for multi-agent reasoning applicable across domains.

### 2.3 Research Area #3: Progressive Context Aggregation

**Research question:** How do we aggregate multi-source context incrementally without semantic drift or contradiction accumulation?

**Technical innovations to develop:**

1. **Incremental synthesis protocols:**
   - Stage-by-stage context integration vs. batch synthesis
   - Conflict resolution mechanisms for contradictory information
   - Context compression techniques maintaining semantic fidelity

2. **Semantic consistency maintenance:**
   - Real-time drift detection during progressive aggregation
