# TRIZ: Theory of Inventive Problem Solving

## Overview

TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving), developed by Genrich Altshuller through analysis of over 200,000 patents, provides systematic methodologies for innovation based on patterns of successful inventive solutions. This framework is fundamental for creating AI systems that can reliably generate innovative solutions.

## Historical Foundation and Development

### Genrich Altshuller's Research
- **Patent Analysis**: Systematic examination of 200,000+ patents across multiple industries
- **Pattern Identification**: Discovery of recurring inventive principles in successful innovations
- **Universal Application**: Recognition that similar problems and solutions appear across different fields
- **Predictable Innovation**: Development of systematic approaches to inventive problem solving

### Core TRIZ Principle
**"Technical systems evolve according to objective laws, and these laws can be learned and applied to consciously advance innovation."**

**Key Insight**: Most technical problems and their solutions follow predictable patterns that can be systematically identified and applied.

## The 40 Inventive Principles

### Fundamental Patterns of Innovation

**1. Segmentation**
- Divide objects into independent parts
- Make objects easy to disassemble
- Increase the degree of fragmentation or segmentation

**2. Taking Out**
- Separate interfering parts or properties from an object
- Single out useful parts or properties
- Example: Remove noise from signal processing

**3. Local Quality**
- Change structure of object from uniform to non-uniform
- Make parts fulfill different functions
- Example: Ergonomic tools adapted to different hand positions

**4. Asymmetry**
- Change shape of object from symmetrical to asymmetrical
- If already asymmetrical, increase degree of asymmetry
- Example: Asymmetric tire treads for improved performance

**5. Merging/Consolidation**
- Bring closer together identical or similar objects
- Make operations contiguous or parallel
- Example: Multi-function devices combining multiple capabilities
