  Stage 2: Innovation Anatomy (Doblin's 10 Types)

  Think of Doblin's 10 Types as the periodic table of innovation - it categorizes ALL possible ways a company can
  innovate, not just "new products."

  The Framework Breakdown:

  Imagine innovation as a 3-layer cake:

  CONFIGURATION (Back-office - How you operate)
  ├── 1. Profit Model: HOW you make money
  ├── 2. Network: WHO you partner with
  ├── 3. Structure: HOW you organize resources
  └── 4. Process: HOW you do your work

  OFFERING (The product itself)
  ├── 5. Product Performance: WHAT it does
  └── 6. Product System: Products that work TOGETHER

  EXPERIENCE (Customer-facing)
  ├── 7. Service: HOW you support customers
  ├── 8. Channel: WHERE customers buy
  ├── 9. Brand: HOW you're perceived
  └── 10. Customer Engagement: HOW you interact

  Real Example: Netflix

  Let's analyze Netflix using Doblin's 10 Types:

  Configuration Changes:
  - Profit Model: Subscription instead of per-rental (Blockbuster model)
  - Network: Content partnerships with studios
  - Process: Recommendation algorithm

  Offering Changes:
  - Product Performance: Streaming quality, offline downloads
  - Product System: Multiple profiles, kids mode

  Experience Changes:
  - Channel: Direct-to-home instead of physical stores
  - Brand: "Netflix and chill" cultural phenomenon
  - Customer Engagement: Personalized homepage

  Why This Matters: Netflix didn't just innovate the product (streaming). They innovated across 7 of the 10 types,
  making them nearly impossible to copy. Blockbuster could have added streaming (1 type) but couldn't replicate the
  entire system.

  CPG Example: Dollar Shave Club

  Configuration:
  - Profit Model: Subscription (new for razors)
  - Process: Direct shipping

  Offering:
  - Product Performance: Good-enough razors

  Experience:
  - Channel: DTC instead of retail
  - Brand: Humor/irreverence vs Gillette's masculinity
  - Service: Auto-replenishment

  The Insight: They innovated in 6 types. Gillette's response (creating their own subscription) only copied 2 types
  and failed.

  Stage 3: Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

  JTBD asks: "What job is the customer hiring this product to do?"

  It's NOT about the product - it's about the customer's struggle.

  The Three Dimensions of Every Job:

  FUNCTIONAL JOB: The practical task
  "I need to [action] so that [outcome]"

  EMOTIONAL JOB: How I want to feel
  "I want to feel [specific emotion]"

  SOCIAL JOB: How I want others to see me
  "I want to be perceived as [identity]"

  Classic Example: Milkshakes

  McDonald's wanted to sell more milkshakes. They discovered people were "hiring" morning milkshakes for a specific
  job:

  Functional Job: "I need to stay occupied during my boring commute so that the drive feels shorter"

  Emotional Job: "I want to feel like I'm treating myself without too much guilt"

  Social Job: "I want to be seen as someone who has their morning routine together"

  The Insight: They weren't competing with other milkshakes - they were competing with bananas, bagels, and 
  podcasts. All things that make commutes bearable.

  The Solution: Make milkshakes thicker (last longer), add chunks (more interesting), position near drive-thru
  (convenient for commuters).

  CPG Example: RXBar

  Traditional View: "It's a protein bar competing with other protein bars"

  JTBD Analysis:

  Functional Job: "I need to know exactly what I'm eating so that I can maintain my diet discipline"

  Emotional Job: "I want to feel smart and in control of my nutrition"

  Social Job: "I want to be seen as someone who makes informed, no-BS choices"

  Constraint Eliminated:
  - Knowledge constraint: No more decoding ingredient lists
  - Time constraint: No research needed - it's on the front of package

  The Result: RXBar succeeded by eliminating the cognitive load of ingredient analysis. The package IS the value
  proposition.

  How Stages 2 & 3 Work Together:

  Stage 2 tells you WHAT kind of innovation it was (which of the 10 types)
  Stage 3 tells you WHY customers cared (what job it did)

  Putting It Together - Oat Milk Example:

  Stage 2 Analysis (Innovation Types):
  - Product Performance: Better environmental footprint
  - Brand: Trendy, sustainable positioning
  - Channel: Coffee shops first, then retail
  - Network: Barista partnerships

  Stage 3 Analysis (Jobs-to-be-Done):
  - Functional: "I need a milk alternative that foams well in coffee"
  - Emotional: "I want to feel good about my environmental impact"
  - Social: "I want to be seen as environmentally conscious and modern"
  - Constraint Eliminated: Guilt about dairy's environmental impact

  The Combined Insight:
  Oat milk succeeded not just by creating a new product (Stage 2: Product Performance) but by solving a social
  identity job (Stage 3: Social Job) through strategic channel innovation (Stage 2: Channel - coffee shops first).

  ---
  Why This Matters for Your Pipeline:

  Without these stages: "Oat milk is popular because it's plant-based"

  With these stages: "Oat milk succeeded by combining product performance innovation with channel strategy (barista
  adoption) to solve the social job of environmental identity signaling while eliminating the guilt constraint of
  dairy consumption"

  The second insight is transferable - you can apply this pattern to any category where environmental guilt exists.

  Your CPG Application:
  - Stage 2 identifies which innovation levers to pull
  - Stage 3 identifies which customer struggles to target
  - Together, they create actionable, mechanism-based opportunities
