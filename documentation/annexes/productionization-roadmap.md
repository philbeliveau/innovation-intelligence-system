---

## What to Improve: Known Issues

### 1. Stage 5 JSON Parsing Failures ⚠️

**Evidence:** 2 of 24 scenarios failed (8.3%) due to malformed JSON

**Impact:** HIGH - Blocks opportunity generation, unacceptable for production

**Root Cause:** LLM occasionally generates invalid JSON with quote escaping errors

**Solution (Priority: CRITICAL):**

**Implementation:**
```python
# Add structured output schema validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, ValidationError

class OpportunityCard(BaseModel):
    title: str
    description: str
    actionability: list[str]
    visual: str
    follow_up_prompts: list[str]

# Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
max_retries = 3
for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        result = stage5_chain.invoke(...)
        validated = OpportunityCard.parse_raw(result)
        break
    except ValidationError as e:
        if attempt < max_retries - 1:
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            continue
        else:
            log_error_and_alert(e)
            raise
```

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks (1 engineer)

**Expected Impact:** Error rate reduction from 8.3% → <2%

---

### 2. Novelty Scores Below Target ⚠️

**Evidence:** 3.18/5.0 average (target: ≥3.5), no scores above 4.0

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Opportunities are solid but not breakthrough

**Root Cause:** Insufficient cross-industry pattern depth, conservative prompt guidance

**Solution (Priority: HIGH):**

**Approach 1: Enhanced Inspiration Sources**
- Expand input diversity beyond trend reports
- Add biomimicry databases (AskNature.org API)
- Include patent analysis for technical innovations
- Incorporate startup funding data (Crunchbase API)

**Approach 2: Prompt Engineering**
```python
# Stage 3 Prompt Enhancement
"Identify UNEXPECTED cross-industry applications.
Look for analogies from nature, physics, or biology.
Prioritize counter-intuitive insights over obvious translations.
Target: principles that would surprise industry insiders."
```

**Approach 3: Two-Pass Generation**
```python
# First pass: Generate safe options
safe_opportunities = stage5_generate(temperature=0.6)

# Second pass: Generate breakthrough options
breakthrough_opportunities = stage5_generate(
    temperature=0.9,
    prompt_override="Generate RADICAL, non-obvious opportunities"
)

# Combine: 3 safe + 2 breakthrough per scenario
final_output = safe_opportunities[:3] + breakthrough_opportunities[:2]
```

**Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks (1 engineer)

**Expected Impact:** Novelty score increase from 3.18 → 3.6

---

### 3. Stage 4 Performance Bottleneck ⚠️

**Evidence:** 69.5s average (49% of total execution time)

**Impact:** LOW - Current speed acceptable, but limits scalability

**Root Cause:** Largest context (brand profile + universal lessons), complex reasoning

**Solution (Priority: MEDIUM):**

**Optimization 1: Context Compression**
```python
# Reduce Stage 3 output before passing to Stage 4
compressed_lessons = summarize_universal_lessons(
    stage3_output,
    target_length=3000  # Down from 5000
)
```

**Optimization 2: Parallel Brand Processing**
```python
# Process multiple brands concurrently for same input
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_input_for_all_brands(input_id, brand_ids):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
        futures = [
            executor.submit(run_stage4, input_id, brand_id)
            for brand_id in brand_ids
        ]
        results = [f.result() for f in futures]
    return results
```

**Optimization 3: Brand Profile Caching**
```python
# Cache parsed brand profiles in memory
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=10)
def load_brand_profile(brand_id):
    with open(f"data/brand-profiles/{brand_id}.yaml") as f:
        return yaml.safe_load(f)
```

**Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks (1 engineer)

**Expected Impact:** Stage 4 time reduction from 69.5s → 45s (35% improvement)
