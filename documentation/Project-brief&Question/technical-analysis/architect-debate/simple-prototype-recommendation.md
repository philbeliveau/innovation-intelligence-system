# Simple Prototype Recommendation: Innovation Intelligence System
**Date:** September 30, 2024
**Author:** Winston - System Architect
**Purpose:** Practical prototype approach for market validation before major technical investment

---

## Executive Summary

**The Bottom Line:** Start with a $25K, 2-week "Wizard of Oz" prototype that simulates your AI intelligence system manually. This validates market demand before investing $3-6M in complex AI infrastructure.

**Why This Works:** You prove customers want innovation intelligence before building the technology to deliver it automatically.

## The Wizard of Oz Prototype Approach

### **What Is It?**
A prototype that appears to customers as an AI-driven intelligence service, but is actually powered by you manually researching and analyzing innovations with AI assistance.

### **Core Value Test**
- Do VP Innovation teams want weekly innovation insights?
- Will they pay $149-449/month for validated intelligence?
- Do they value the SPECTRE validation framework approach?
- How do they want to consume this intelligence?

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### **Customer Acquisition Risk**
**Risk:** Can't get enough subscribers for validation
**Mitigation:**
- Leverage personal network for initial subscribers
- Partner with innovation communities and conferences
- Use LinkedIn outreach to VP Innovation targets
- Content marketing and SEO for organic growth

### **Content Quality Risk**
**Risk:** Manual analysis isn't good enough to validate AI potential
**Mitigation:**
- Use AI tools for initial analysis (GPT-4, Claude)
- Validate with industry experts and advisors
- Focus on curation and context vs. raw analysis
- Set clear quality thresholds for customer satisfaction

### **Time Investment Risk**
**Risk:** Too much time required for manual process
**Mitigation:**
- Limit scope to 1-2 insights per week initially
- Use templates and frameworks for efficiency
- Automate routine tasks (email, scheduling, surveys)
- Plan automation roadmap for proven components

### **Customer Feedback Risk**
**Risk:** Customers tell you what you want to hear
**Mitigation:**
- Ask open-ended, neutral questions
- Include skeptical questions about approach
- Validate through behavior (payment) not just words
- Cross-validate feedback across multiple customers

## What to Tell Your Boss About the Prototype

### **The Pitch:**
"Before investing $3-6M in complex AI infrastructure, let's spend $25K and 4 weeks proving customers actually want innovation intelligence. We'll simulate the service manually and test customer demand, pricing, and engagement. If validation succeeds, we'll have a clear roadmap for technical development. If it fails, we've saved millions on the wrong product."

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Low Risk:** $25K vs. $3-6M investment
- **Fast Learning:** 4 weeks vs. 12+ months
- **Customer-Centric:** Validates demand before building supply
- **Flexible:** Can pivot based on real customer feedback
- **Capital Efficient:** Proves business model before technical scaling

### **Expected Outcomes:**
- Clear evidence of customer demand (or lack thereof)
- Validated pricing model and revenue potential
- Understanding of customer workflows and needs
- Proof of concept for content quality and engagement
- Go/no-go decision framework for major investment

**Bottom Line:** This prototype approach turns a high-risk technical bet into a low-risk market validation experiment. Smart money validates the market before building the product.
