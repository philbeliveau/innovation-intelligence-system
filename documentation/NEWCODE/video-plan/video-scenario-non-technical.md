## 🎬 Video Script

### **[0:00-0:30] Hook - The Problem**

**Screen Recording:**
- Browser showing innovation app
- Click "Upload Document"
- Loading spinner appears...
- Wait... wait... wait... (speed up to 5 seconds)
- Still spinning. Nothing happens.

**Narration:**
> "I uploaded a document to my website 10 minutes ago. It's still stuck on this loading screen. Nothing's happening.
>
> Before AI, I'd either:
> - Wait for my developer friend to call me back (2 days)
> - Pay someone $500 to fix it (3-5 day wait)
> - Or just give up
>
> Today, I'm going to fix it myself. In about 5 minutes. Watch."

**Text overlay (animated):**
```
Problem: Website stuck loading
Old way: Wait days, pay $$$
New way: Ask AI to fix it
```

---

### **[0:30-1:00] Ask AI for Help**

**Screen Recording:**
- Split screen: Browser (left) showing broken website
- Claude Code (right) - clean interface

**Typed message to Claude (show typing animation):**
```
My website is broken. When users upload documents,
it just shows a spinning loader forever and never finishes.
Can you figure out what's wrong?
```

**Narration:**
> "I'm just typing exactly what I see. No technical language. Just describing the problem like I would to a friend."

**Claude's response (show on screen, simplified):**
```
I'll investigate your system to find what's causing this.
Checking:
✓ Your website code
✓ Your database
✓ Your server

This will take about 1 minute...
```

**Text overlay:**
```
AI is investigating 3 different systems
(You don't need to know which ones or how)
```

---

### **[1:00-2:00] Watch AI Work**

**Screen Recording:**
- Claude reading files (blur/fast-forward, make it look smart)
- Show progress indicators
- Add fun visual effects (scanning lines, checkmarks)

**Narration:**
> "Claude is now reading through different parts of my system. It's checking:
>
> - The website visitors see
> - Where data gets stored
> - The computer server running everything
>
> I'm not telling it where to look. It figures that out on its own."

**Visual overlay (animated checkboxes):**
```
✓ Checking website...
✓ Checking database...
✓ Checking server...
⚠ Found the problem!
```

**Claude's message (simplified, show on screen):**
```
Found it! Two issues:

1. You made changes to your website yesterday,
   but those changes were never actually published live.

   (Like writing an email but forgetting to hit Send)

2. There's a typo in how your system reads company names.
   It's looking for the wrong field.

I can fix both of these for you.
```

**Text overlay:**
```
Translation:
Issue 1: New code not deployed ← Common mistake
Issue 2: Small typo in data field ← Easy fix
```

---

### **[2:00-2:30] The Fix**

**Screen Recording:**
- Show Claude's suggested fixes (simplified language)
- Show "Apply Fix" button (visualize as one-click)

**Narration:**
> "Claude found two problems and is telling me exactly how to fix them.
>
> I'm going to click 'Apply Fix' and 'Publish Changes'.
>
> That's it. I'm not writing code. I'm just clicking buttons."

**Visual sequence:**
1. **Button 1:** "Fix the typo" → Click → ✓ Done
2. **Button 2:** "Publish new website version" → Click → Progress bar
3. **Progress:** "Publishing... 30 seconds remaining..."
4. **Complete:** "✓ Your website is now live with the fixes"

**Text overlay:**
```
2 clicks = 2 fixes = 1 working website
```

---

### **[2:30-3:00] Verification - It Works!**

**Screen Recording:**
- Back to browser
- Refresh page
- Upload same document again
- THIS TIME: Progress bar updates!

**Progress visualization (simple, friendly):**
```
Analyzing document...
✓ Step 1 complete
✓ Step 2 complete
✓ Step 3 complete
✓ Step 4 complete
✓ Step 5 complete

Analysis Complete! ✓
```

**Narration:**
> "Let's test it. Upload the same document...
>
> And now it works. The progress bar moves. Each step completes.
>
> And here are my results. 5 innovation ideas, fully analyzed.
>
> Problem solved. 5 minutes, just like I said."

**Split screen:**
- Left: Results page showing innovation cards
- Right: Stopwatch showing "Total time: 4:37"

### **[3:00-3:30] The Comparison**

**Screen with simple comparison table (animated):**

| Without AI | With AI |
|------------|---------|
| Email developer | Ask Claude |
| Wait 2-3 days | Wait 5 minutes |
| Pay $300-500 | Free (Claude subscription) |
| Hope they understood the problem | AI investigates automatically |
| Cross fingers | Know it's fixed |

**Narration:**
> "Think about what just happened:
>
> **Before AI:**
> - I email my developer
> - Wait 2 days for a response
> - Pay $500 for a fix
> - Hope it works
>
> **With AI:**
> - I describe the problem in plain English
> - AI investigates 3 different systems
> - Finds 2 bugs I didn't know existed
> - Fixes both in under 5 minutes
>
> This is why AI is changing everything."

---

### **[3:30-4:00] The Takeaway**

**Screen: Simple text slides (minimal, clean)**

**Narration:**
> "Here's what you need to know:
>
> **1. You don't need to code**
> Just describe what's broken. AI does the technical investigation.
>
> **2. AI is REALLY good at debugging**
> It checked my website code, my database, and my server. Automatically. In parallel.
>
> **3. It finds problems you didn't know existed**
> I asked about the loading spinner. It also found a typo in my data fields.
>
> **4. Time savings are real**
> 5 minutes instead of days. Every single time.
>
> **This is programming in 2025.**
> You don't write code. You describe what you want. AI makes it happen."
