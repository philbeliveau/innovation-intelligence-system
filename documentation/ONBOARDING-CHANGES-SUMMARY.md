# Onboarding Flow Changes Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** Architecture & PRD Updated

---

## Overview

Updated the web app architecture to include a **team-led onboarding flow** where company context is pre-selected before homepage access. This enables clean client presentations without exposing multi-brand selector UI.

---

## Key Changes

### 1. New Onboarding Page (`/onboarding`)

**Purpose:** Team member selects target company before client demo

**Flow:**
1. Navigate to `/onboarding`
2. Select company from dropdown (Lactalis, McCormick, Columbia, Decathlon)
3. System loads brand profile from `/data/brand-profiles/{company-id}.yaml`
4. Company ID saved to HTTP-only cookie (7-day expiry)
5. Redirect to homepage with company context pre-loaded

**Implementation:**
- `app/onboarding/page.tsx` - Onboarding UI
- `app/api/onboarding/set-company/route.ts` - Loads YAML, sets cookie
- `app/api/onboarding/current-company/route.ts` - Reads current company from cookie

---

### 2. Updated Homepage (`/`)

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ **Company name displayed** at top-right corner (e.g., "Lactalis Canada üè¢")
- ‚ùå **No brand selector dropdown** (already set in onboarding)
- ‚úÖ **Redirect to `/onboarding`** if no company cookie found
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner UI** for client presentations

**API Changes:**
- `/api/run` now reads `brand_id` from cookie (not from request body)
- Returns 400 error if no company set ‚Üí frontend redirects to onboarding

---

### 3. Brand Profile Integration

**Data Source:** `/data/brand-profiles/{company-id}.yaml`

**Files Available:**
- `lactalis-canada.yaml`
- `mccormick-usa.yaml`
- `columbia-sportswear.yaml`
- `decathlon.yaml`

**Data Loaded:**
```yaml
brand_name: Lactalis Canada
country: Canada
industry: Dairy / Food & Beverage
positioning: "Canada's premier dairy company..."
product_portfolio: [...]
target_customers: [...]
recent_innovations: [...]
strategic_priorities: [...]
brand_values: [...]
```

**Usage:**
- `brand_name` ‚Üí Display on homepage
- `positioning`, `strategic_priorities`, `brand_values` ‚Üí Used in pipeline Stages 4-5
- Cookie stores only `company_id`, full profile loaded on-demand

---

## Implementation Roadmap Updates

### New Phase: Hour 1-2 (Onboarding Page)

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create `app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- [ ] Company selector dropdown (4 options)

## API Specification Updates

### New: `POST /api/onboarding/set-company`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "company_id": "lactalis-canada"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "company_id": "lactalis-canada",
  "company_name": "Lactalis Canada",
  "brand_profile": { ... }
}
```

**Side Effect:** Sets HTTP-only cookie `company_id` with 7-day expiry

---

### New: `GET /api/onboarding/current-company`

**Response:**
```json

  "company_id": "lactalis-canada",
  "company_name": "Lactalis Canada"

```

**Error (404):**
```json

  "error": "No company selected"
}
```

---

### Updated: `POST /api/run`

  "blob_url": "https://...",
  "brand_id": "lactalis-canada"  // Passed in request
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "blob_url": "https://..."
  // brand_id read from cookie server-side
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Returns 400 if no `company_id` cookie found
- Frontend redirects to `/onboarding` on 400 error

  ‚Üì
Select Company (Team Member)
