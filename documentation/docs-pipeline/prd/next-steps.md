# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt

Now that the PRD is complete, please proceed with technical architecture design:

**Prompt for Solution Architect:**

> I need you to design the technical architecture for the Innovation Intelligence Pipeline Testing System based on the PRD at `docs/prd.md`.
>
> **Key Requirements:**
> - **LangChain-based pipeline** with 5 sequential stages (SequentialChain)
> - **Python 3.10+** implementation
> - **LLM Provider:** OpenRouter for Claude Sonnet 4.5 access (using langchain-openai)
> - **Stages 1-3:** Offline document processing (PDF input from `documentation/document/`)
> - **Stage 4:** Offline with pre-existing research data integration from local files
> - **Stage 5:** Opportunity generation with Jinja2 templating
> - **Execution:** Single test (`python run_pipeline.py --input X --brand Y`) and batch mode (`--batch` for all 20 tests)
> - **Output:** 100 opportunity cards total (20 tests × 5 opportunities each)
>
> **Focus Areas:**
> 1. LangChain chain architecture - how stages connect and pass context
> 2. OpenRouter integration with ChatOpenAI configuration
> 3. Brand profile YAML schema
> 4. Opportunity card output format (markdown with frontmatter)
> 5. Research data loading approach from local files
> 6. Error handling strategy for non-fatal failures
> 7. Logging and intermediate output storage
>
> **Deliverables:**
> - Architecture document (`docs/architecture.md`) with chain diagrams
> - Data models for brand profiles and opportunity cards
> - File structure specification
> - LangChain component specifications for each stage
> - OpenRouter configuration details
>
> **Constraints:**
> - This is a throwaway demo for validation (1-2 week build target)
> - Prioritize simplicity over production quality
> - No database - file-based storage only
> - Manual quality review acceptable
>
> Please create the architecture document based on the complete PRD.
