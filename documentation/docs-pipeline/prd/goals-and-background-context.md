# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Validate that automated pipeline can systematically transform market signals into brand-specific, actionable innovation opportunities
- Establish baseline quality threshold for "actionable opportunity" that justifies customer payment ($149-$1,500/month tiers)
- Prove differentiation capability by generating meaningfully different outputs across 4 brands from identical inputs
- Benchmark pipeline execution speed to determine feasibility of "daily opportunities" delivery tier
- Generate 100 opportunity cards across 20 test scenarios (5 inputs × 4 brands × 5 opportunities each) for empirical validation
- Build rapid demo to validate core hypothesis with minimal development time
- Document complete pipeline process to enable future productionization by development team
- Identify pipeline bottlenecks, failure modes, and data source requirements through systematic testing

## Background Context

The Innovation Intelligence System business concept proposes delivering "freshly baked" innovation opportunities to CPG companies, but the core value proposition remains unvalidated. The fundamental question is whether an automated system can systematically convert generic market signals (trend reports, case studies, spotted innovations) into high-value, brand-specific opportunities that innovation teams will pay for.

This PRD defines an MVP testing pipeline that will validate or invalidate the business hypothesis. The pipeline processes inputs through 5 stages: (1) Input Processing, (2) Signal Amplification, (3) General Translation, (4) Brand Contextualization, and (5) Opportunity Generation. By testing across 4 diverse brands (Lactalis Canada, McCormick USA, Columbia Sportswear, Decathlon) with 5 different input types, we can empirically measure quality, differentiation, speed, and consistency—the critical unknowns blocking business validation.

The system leverages existing BMAD agent orchestration framework and innovation intelligence research (TRIZ, SIT, biomimicry, SPECTRE validation) documented in `documentation/document/`. Success means proving the transformation works; failure means identifying why contextualization or opportunity generation breaks down, enabling informed pivot decisions.
