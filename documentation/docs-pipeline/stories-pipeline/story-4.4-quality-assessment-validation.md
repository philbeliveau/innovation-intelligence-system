# Story 4.4: Quality Assessment and Business Hypothesis Validation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** structured quality assessment of all 24 opportunity cards generated in Story 4.3 using scoring rubric,
**so that** I can validate whether pipeline outputs justify customer payment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quality scoring rubric created in `docs/opportunity-quality-rubric.md`:
   - **Novelty (1-5):** Is this a fresh idea, or obvious/generic?
   - **Actionability (1-5):** Are next steps concrete and implementable?
   - **Relevance (1-5):** Does this authentically fit the brand's context and capabilities?
   - **Specificity (1-5):** Is this detailed enough to act on, or too vague?
   - **Overall Score:** Average of 4 dimensions
2. **Input Source (from Story 4.3):** All opportunity cards from `data/test-outputs/` directory generated by Story 4.3 batch execution
   - 24 total opportunity cards (6 inputs × 4 brands = 24 scenarios)
   - Reference `data/test-outputs/batch-summary.md` for complete list of scenarios
3. Sampling strategy: Review ALL 24 opportunity cards using rubric (manageable sample size for comprehensive assessment)
4. Quality assessment spreadsheet created: `data/quality-assessment.csv` with columns: scenario_id, brand, input_source, novelty, actionability, relevance, specificity, overall_score, notes
5. Manual scoring completed by PM on all 24 opportunity cards
6. Results analysis:
   - Average overall score calculated (target: ≥3.5 per KPI table)
   - % of opportunities scoring ≥3.0 (target: ≥70%)
   - Breakdown by dimension: which dimensions are strong/weak?
7. Differentiation validation: Select 5 opportunities generated from same input across different brands, verify they are meaningfully different (qualitative assessment)
8. Business hypothesis validation documented in `docs/validation-results.md`:
   - **Transformation works?** Can pipeline systematically generate opportunities from signals? (Yes/No + evidence)
   - **Quality sufficient?** Would innovation teams pay for these opportunities? (Yes/No + rationale)
   - **Differentiation proven?** Do outputs vary meaningfully by brand? (Yes/No + examples)
   - **Speed feasible?** Can we deliver daily opportunities? (Yes/No + execution time data)
   - **Recommendation:** Proceed to productionization, pivot, or iterate? (Decision + reasoning)

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Opportunity Generation & Complete Testing (Stage 5)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 4.3 (Complete 20-Test Batch Execution) - **MUST BE COMPLETED FIRST**

**Critical Input Requirements from Story 4.3:**
- All 24 opportunity card files from `data/test-outputs/` directory
- Batch summary report at `data/test-outputs/batch-summary.md` (for scenario list and execution metrics)
- File naming convention used by Story 4.3 batch execution
- Intermediate outputs from Stages 2, 3, 4 (for differentiation analysis)

**Technical Requirements:**
- This is the critical business hypothesis validation story
- Manual quality assessment (no automation for MVP)
- **ALL 24 cards assessed** (changed from 20% sample - manageable size for comprehensive review)
- Target: ≥3.5 average score, ≥70% scoring 3.0+
- **Output for Story 4.5:** Top 5 highest-scoring cards identified for executive handoff
