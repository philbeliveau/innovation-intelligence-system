# Story 3.1: Pre-Existing Research Data Integration

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** pipeline developer,
**I want** to load and access pre-existing research data from local files,
**so that** Stage 4 can use completed brand research without live web searches.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Research data loader created in `pipeline/utils.py`: `load_research_data(brand_id)` function that reads from `docs/web-search-setup/{brand-id}-research.md`
2. Function loads single comprehensive markdown file per brand containing 8 strategic sections (~550-720 lines, 35-48KB):
   - Brand Overview & Positioning
   - Product Portfolio & Innovation
   - Recent Innovations (Last 18 Months)
   - Strategic Priorities & Business Strategy
   - Target Customers & Market Positioning
   - Sustainability & Social Responsibility
   - Competitive Context & Market Trends
   - Recent News & Market Signals (Last 6 Months)
3. Function returns complete research content as string for injection into Stage 4 prompt
4. Test script created: `test_research_loader.py` that:
   - Lists all 4 available research files (lactalis-canada, mccormick-usa, columbia-sportswear, decathlon)
   - Loads each research file and verifies successful parsing (UTF-8 encoding)
   - Validates file statistics: line count, size, confirms 8 sections present
   - Tests graceful handling of missing files
5. Error handling implemented: If research file missing or unreadable, log warning and return empty string (non-fatal)
6. Logging added: Log file path, line count, and size (KB) when research data loaded
7. Documentation: `docs/brand-research-data-structure.md` documents the 8-section format, file naming convention (`{brand-id}-research.md`), and Stage 4 integration pattern

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Brand Contextualization with Research Data (Stage 4)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.4 (Output Directory Structure and Logging)
- Pre-existing research files in `docs/web-search-setup/`

**Technical Requirements:**
- Research files are in `docs/web-search-setup/` directory
- Files are markdown format with consistent structure
- UTF-8 encoding required
- Graceful degradation if files missing (non-fatal error)

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Function must handle missing files gracefully
- Logging provides visibility into research data usage
- Research files average 35-48KB, 550-720 lines
- 8 strategic sections provide comprehensive brand context

**File Naming Convention:**
- Pattern: `{brand-id}-research.md`
- Examples: `lactalis-canada-research.md`, `mccormick-usa-research.md`

### Testing
**Test file location:** Root directory (`test_research_loader.py`)
**Test standards:** Verify successful file loading and error handling
**Testing frameworks:** Python file I/O, UTF-8 encoding
**Specific requirements:**
- Test all 4 brand research files
- Verify UTF-8 encoding handling
- Validate file statistics (lines, size, sections)
- Test missing file error handling
- Confirm non-fatal error behavior

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: Excellent** ✓

The implementation demonstrates high-quality software engineering practices with clean, maintainable code. The `load_research_data()` function is well-designed with:
- Comprehensive docstring documenting all 8 research sections
- Proper type hints for function signature
- UTF-8 encoding explicitly specified
- Non-fatal error handling with informative logging
- Clear separation of concerns (file I/O, error handling, logging)

The test script provides thorough validation coverage, and documentation is comprehensive with clear examples.

### Refactoring Performed

**Fixed test quality issue:**

- **File**: `test_research_loader.py:56-65`
  - **Change**: Corrected section marker patterns from `# Section Name` to `## N. Section Name`
  - **Why**: Test was reporting false warnings (1/8 sections found) despite all 8 sections being present in research files
  - **How**: Updated expected_sections list to match actual research file format with numbered level-2 headers
  - **Result**: All tests now correctly validate 8/8 sections ✓

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (clean code, type hints, proper docstrings)
- Project Structure: ✓ (follows established patterns in `pipeline/utils.py`)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (test coverage validates all acceptance criteria)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (all 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and validated)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed section marker bug in test script (test_research_loader.py:56-65)
- [x] Validated all 8 sections are correctly detected in research files
- [x] Confirmed UTF-8 encoding handling across all 4 brand files
- [x] Verified non-fatal error handling with missing file test
- [ ] Consider adding pytest integration for automated test execution in CI/CD
- [ ] Consider adding file size validation (warn if outside 35-48KB range)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✓

No security concerns identified:
- Read-only file operations with no user-controlled paths
- UTF-8 encoding explicitly specified (prevents encoding vulnerabilities)
- Graceful error handling prevents information disclosure
- No injection vectors or security-sensitive operations

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✓

Performance is appropriate for the use case:
- File sizes are manageable (35-48KB) and load efficiently
- Single file read per brand with no unnecessary I/O
- Logging provides visibility without performance impact
- Function is designed for integration into pipeline (one-time load per execution)

**Recommendation**: If research data is used multiple times in same pipeline run, consider caching the loaded content to avoid redundant file I/O.

### NFR Validation

- **Reliability**: PASS ✓ - Robust error handling with graceful degradation
- **Maintainability**: PASS ✓ - Clear code structure with comprehensive documentation
- **Observability**: PASS ✓ - Informative logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Testability**: PASS ✓ - Function design supports easy testing with directory parameter

### Files Modified During Review
