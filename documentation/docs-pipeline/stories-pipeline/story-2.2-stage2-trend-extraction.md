# Story 2.2: Stage 2 - Trend Extraction from Document Content

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** pipeline developer,
**I want** Stage 2 implemented to extract trend patterns from document content without external social media data,
**so that** the pipeline can amplify signals using only the information present in input documents.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. File created: `pipeline/stages/stage2_signal_amplification.py` with `Stage2Chain` class
2. LangChain PromptTemplate defined in `pipeline/prompts/stage2_prompt.py` with methodology:
   - Analyze Stage 1 inspirations for recurring themes and patterns
   - Identify underlying trends: consumer behavior shifts, industry movements, emerging needs
   - Extract relevant broader context (industry trends mentioned in document)
   - Categorize trends by: behavioral, technological, cultural, economic
3. Trend extraction methodology documented in `docs/stage2-trend-methodology.md` explaining pattern recognition approach
4. Stage 2 chain receives Stage 1 output as input variable
5. Output format: Structured markdown with sections: "Identified Trends" (bulleted with categories), "Signal Strength Assessment" (high/medium/low per trend), "Trend Context"
6. Stage 2 integrated into `run_pipeline.py` with output saved to `stage2/trend-analysis.md`
7. Test execution: Run on Savannah Bananas → Stage 1 → Stage 2, verify trends extracted without requiring external data
8. Manual review confirms trends are derived from document content, not LLM general knowledge

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Document Processing Pipeline (Stages 1-3)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.1 (Stage 1 - Input Processing)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Stage 2 must work offline (no external data sources)
- Trend extraction based solely on document content analysis
- Pattern recognition from document themes only
- Document methodology for transparency

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Critical constraint: No external data sources allowed
- Trends must be derivable from document content alone
- Signal amplification through pattern recognition, not external validation
- Quality control: Manual review required to prevent hallucination

**Methodology Documentation:**
- Explain how trends are identified from inspirations
- Detail categorization framework
- Provide transparency for validation

### Testing
**Test file location:** Integration with `run_pipeline.py`
**Test standards:** Manual quality review for document-derived trends
**Testing frameworks:** LangChain, manual review
**Specific requirements:**
- Test with Savannah Bananas → Stage 1 → Stage 2 flow
- Verify no external data dependencies
- Manual review to confirm trends from document content only
- Validate categorization (behavioral, technological, cultural, economic)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: Excellent** (95/100)

Story 2.2 demonstrates high-quality implementation with clean code architecture, comprehensive documentation, and successful test execution. All 8 acceptance criteria are fully met. The implementation follows established Stage 1 patterns consistently, uses appropriate LangChain abstractions, and maintains excellent separation of concerns.

**Strengths:**
- Clean, well-structured code with complete type hints and docstrings
- Comprehensive 199-line methodology documentation
- Successful test execution with high-quality output (4 trends properly categorized)
- Proper environment variable validation and error handling
- Consistent with established architectural patterns
- No security vulnerabilities identified

**Deep Review Triggered:** Story has 8 acceptance criteria (>5), requiring comprehensive analysis per review protocol.

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `pipeline/stages/stage2_signal_amplification.py`
- **Change**: Added input validation to `run()` method (lines 103-114)
- **Why**: Original implementation had no validation for stage1_output parameter, which could lead to cryptic downstream errors if Stage 1 failed or returned empty output
- **How**: Added validation checks for empty/whitespace-only input (raises ValueError) and warning for unusually short input (<100 chars). Improves reliability and debugging experience without breaking existing functionality.

**Note to Dev**: Please update the File List in the story to include this QA-driven refactoring if you agree with the changes.

### Gate Status

**Gate**: PASS → `docs/qa/gates/2.2-stage2-trend-extraction.yml`

**Quality Score**: 95/100

**Gate Criteria Met:**
- All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented ✓
- Code quality excellent (clean architecture, proper standards) ✓
- Security: No vulnerabilities (PASS) ✓
- Performance: Appropriate configuration (PASS) ✓
- Reliability: Input validation added (PASS) ✓
- Maintainability: Well-documented and structured (PASS) ✓
- Test execution successful with quality output ✓

**Minor Deductions:**
- -5 points: No unit tests for Stage2Chain class (acceptable per testing strategy, but recommended for future)

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done**

All acceptance criteria met, code quality excellent, standards compliant, and test execution successful. The input validation refactoring improves reliability without breaking existing functionality. Two optional future improvements identified (unit tests, output format validation) but neither is blocking for production readiness.
