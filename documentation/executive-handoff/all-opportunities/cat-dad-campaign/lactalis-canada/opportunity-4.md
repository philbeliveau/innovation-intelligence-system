# Gen Z-Focused Social Media Campaign

## Description

Lactalis Canada can launch a Gen Z-focused social media campaign highlighting their sustainability efforts and plant-based/lactose-free products. This campaign would leverage platforms like TikTok and Instagram, featuring authentic, engaging content created in collaboration with influencers. Themes could include 'Zero Carbon, Zero Compromise' and 'Dairy for Everyone,' showcasing Lactalis’ inclusivity and ESG leadership. This innovation aligns with Lactalis’ digital transformation priority and ensures future relevance with younger consumers. Leveraging insights from Stage 4, this builds on Lactalis’ recent innovations like the Enjoy plant-based line and lactose-free portfolio, addressing flexitarian and lactose-intolerant trends.

- Develop campaign content (e.g., videos, posts) highlighting sustainability and inclusivity.
- Launch the campaign on TikTok, Instagram, and other Gen Z-focused platforms.
