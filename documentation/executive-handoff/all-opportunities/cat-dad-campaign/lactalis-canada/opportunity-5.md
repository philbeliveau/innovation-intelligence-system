# Cooking Show Sponsorship with Dairy Alternatives

## Description

Lactalis Canada can sponsor cooking segments on Canadian TV shows and partner with food festivals to feature their plant-based and lactose-free products. This initiative would normalize dairy alternatives by integrating them into mainstream cultural platforms. For example, Lactalis could sponsor a segment on a popular Canadian cooking show where chefs use Enjoy plant-based products and lactose-free cheese. This innovation reduces resistance to dairy alternatives and increases awareness and adoption. Leveraging insights from Stage 4, this builds on Lactalis’ recent innovations like the Enjoy plant-based line and lactose-free portfolio, addressing flexitarian and lactose-intolerant trends.

## Actionability

- Identify and partner with Canadian cooking shows and food festivals.
- Develop product placement strategies for Enjoy plant-based and lactose-free products.
- Create promotional materials (e.g., recipes, videos) for use in sponsored segments.
- Measure the impact on product awareness and sales.
