# Functional Dairy+ Line with Adaptogens

## Description

Lactalis Canada can introduce a new product line called 'Functional Dairy+' that combines traditional dairy with adaptogens and functional ingredients like probiotics, vitamins, and plant-based superfoods. This line would include products such as adaptogen-infused milk, probiotic-enriched yogurt, and high-protein cheese. These offerings cater to health-conscious consumers seeking holistic wellness solutions. This innovation taps into the growing demand for functional foods and positions Lactalis as a leader in wellness-focused dairy. Leveraging insights from Stage 4, this aligns with Lactalis’ strategic priorities of diversifying the product portfolio and catering to health-conscious families. The feasibility is supported by Lactalis’ existing expertise in high-protein and low-sugar yogurt innovations.

## Actionability

- Conduct consumer research with health-conscious families and fitness-oriented consumers to validate product concepts.
- Partner with a nutrition science firm to develop functional ingredient formulations.
- Prototype three initial products (e.g., adaptogen-infused milk, probiotic yogurt, high-protein cheese) for market testing.
- Develop a marketing plan targeting health-conscious consumers through digital and in-store channels.
