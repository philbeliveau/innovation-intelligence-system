# Regenerative Dairy Farming Initiative

## Description

Lactalis Canada can partner with Canadian regenerative agriculture organizations to launch a 'Regenerative Dairy Farming Initiative.' This initiative would support dairy farmers in adopting regenerative practices, such as soil health improvement and carbon sequestration. Lactalis would highlight this partnership in marketing campaigns and on product packaging (e.g., 'Sourced from Regenerative Farms'). This innovation strengthens Lactalis’ ESG leadership and farmer relationships while appealing to eco-conscious consumers. Leveraging insights from Stage 4, this aligns with Lactalis’ commitment to responsible sourcing and community engagement, as demonstrated by their $70,000 donation to provincial organic associations.

## Actionability

- Identify and partner with regenerative agriculture organizations in Canada.
- Develop a pilot program with select dairy farmers to implement regenerative practices.
- Create marketing materials (e.g., packaging, campaigns) highlighting the initiative.
- Measure and communicate the environmental impact of the program.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we scale this initiative across all Canadian dairy farms?
2. What would success look like in terms of farmer adoption and consumer perception?
3. Which additional partners could help amplify the impact of this initiative?
