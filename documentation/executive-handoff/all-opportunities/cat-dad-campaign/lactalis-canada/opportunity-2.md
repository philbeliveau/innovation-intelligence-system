# Interactive Sustainability Dashboard

## Description

Lactalis Canada can create an interactive 'Sustainability Impact Dashboard' on their website and mobile app, showcasing key sustainability metrics such as emissions reduction, packaging lightweighting, and regenerative agriculture initiatives. This dashboard would include visualizations, infographics, and storytelling elements to communicate Lactalis’ ESG leadership transparently. QR codes on product packaging could link consumers directly to the dashboard. This innovation addresses the growing consumer demand for transparency and aligns with Lactalis’ ESG strategic priorities. Leveraging insights from Stage 4, this builds on Lactalis’ existing sustainability achievements like the zero-carbon ready distribution center and PVC-free packaging. It enhances trust and loyalty among eco-conscious consumers.

## Actionability

- Collaborate with a data visualization firm to design the dashboard interface.
- Compile and verify sustainability metrics (e.g., emissions reduction, packaging avoided) for dashboard content.
- Develop QR codes for product packaging linking to the dashboard.
- Launch a marketing campaign to promote the dashboard to eco-conscious consumers.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt the dashboard for different customer segments (e.g., families, Gen Z)?
2. What additional metrics could we include to enhance transparency and engagement?
3. Which partners could help amplify the reach and impact of this dashboard?
