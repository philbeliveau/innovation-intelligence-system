# Sustainable Performance Validation Program

## Description

Launch a service initiative to validate and communicate the performance benefits of Columbia’s sustainable materials. This program will include rigorous testing and certification of recycled and eco-friendly materials, showcasing their durability, weather resistance, and comfort compared to traditional materials. The findings will be used to create a 'Sustainable Performance' seal for qualifying products, providing consumers with transparent, data-driven assurance. This service will enhance Columbia’s credibility with eco-conscious consumers and differentiate the brand from competitors. This initiative leverages Columbia’s ongoing sustainability efforts and aligns with the growing consumer demand for eco-friendly products.

## Actionability

- Partner with an independent testing lab to conduct comparative studies on sustainable vs. traditional materials.
- Develop a 'Sustainable Performance' certification process and seal for qualifying products.
- Create a dedicated section on the Columbia website to showcase the testing results and certified products.
- Integrate the 'Sustainable Performance' seal into product packaging and marketing materials.
