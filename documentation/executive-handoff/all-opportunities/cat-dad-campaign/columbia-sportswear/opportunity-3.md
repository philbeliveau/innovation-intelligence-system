# Inclusive Outdoor Adventure Kits

## Description

Introduce a new line of inclusive outdoor adventure kits designed for diverse adventurers, including families and individuals with disabilities. These kits will feature adaptive gear, such as jackets with magnetic closures for limited dexterity, and family-focused products like coordinating gear for parents and kids. The kits will also include guides and resources to help diverse groups plan and enjoy outdoor activities. This innovation supports Columbia’s commitment to inclusivity and aligns with the brand’s portfolio diversification strategy. By addressing underserved markets, Columbia can expand its customer base and strengthen its reputation as an inclusive brand.

## Actionability

- Conduct focus groups with families and individuals with disabilities to identify specific needs and preferences.
- Develop prototypes of adaptive outdoor gear, such as jackets with magnetic closures and easy-to-use zippers.
- Partner with organizations like Adaptive Sports USA to test and promote the new adventure kits.
- Create a dedicated online resource center with guides and tips for inclusive outdoor activities.
