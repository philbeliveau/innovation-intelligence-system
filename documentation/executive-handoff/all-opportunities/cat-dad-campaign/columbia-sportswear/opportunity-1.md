# Everyday Resilience Urban Gear Line

## Description

Develop a new product line specifically designed for urban and suburban lifestyles, leveraging Columbia’s proprietary technologies like Omni-Heat and Omni-Shield. This line will include versatile, stylish, and functional gear tailored for daily challenges such as commuting, running errands, and managing active family life. Products could feature modular designs, weather-resistant fabrics, and smart storage solutions. This line will position Columbia as a brand that supports resilience in everyday life, not just outdoor adventures. This innovation aligns with the 'Engineered for Whatever' platform and expands Columbia’s appeal beyond core outdoor enthusiasts to urban consumers.

## Actionability

- Conduct customer research with urban and suburban consumers to identify key pain points and preferences.
- Prototype a modular urban jacket with weather-resistant fabric and smart storage features.
- Partner with urban lifestyle influencers to test and promote the new product line.
- Develop a marketing campaign showcasing the gear in urban scenarios like commuting and family outings.
