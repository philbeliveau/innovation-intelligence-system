# Interactive In-Store Sports Zones

## Description

Create interactive in-store sports zones that allow customers to test equipment and experience different sports in a controlled environment. These zones will feature augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) experiences, along with physical testing areas for sports like cycling, running, and climbing. The goal is to provide an immersive experience that helps customers make informed purchasing decisions and encourages them to try new sports. This initiative will enhance the in-store experience and drive engagement across all customer segments.

## Actionability

- Design and prototype AR/VR experiences for at least three sports categories
- Set up physical testing areas in flagship stores with safety measures in place
- Train staff to guide customers through the interactive zones and provide expert advice
- Develop a feedback system to continuously improve the experience based on customer input

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we integrate these zones with our e-commerce platform for a seamless omnichannel experience?
2. What sports categories would benefit most from interactive testing and why?
3. How can we use data from these zones to enhance product development and marketing?
