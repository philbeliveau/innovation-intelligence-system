# Virtual Sports Coach Service

## Description

Launch a virtual sports coach service that provides personalized training plans, video tutorials, and live coaching sessions for beginners and casual enthusiasts. This service would be integrated with Decathlon's e-commerce platform, offering tailored equipment recommendations and access to a community of fellow athletes. The virtual coach would use AI to adapt training plans based on user progress and feedback, making it an accessible and affordable alternative to traditional coaching. This service would help beginners overcome intimidation and build confidence in their chosen sports.

## Actionability

- Partner with local sports coaches and influencers to create video tutorials
- Integrate the virtual coach service with the e-commerce platform for seamless equipment recommendations
- Launch a pilot program with 500 users to gather feedback and refine the service
