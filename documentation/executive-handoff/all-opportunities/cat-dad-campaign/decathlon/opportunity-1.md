# Modular Sports Gear System

## Description

Develop a modular sports gear system that allows customers to customize and upgrade their equipment based on their evolving needs and skill levels. This system would include interchangeable components for various sports (e.g., detachable bike parts, adjustable hiking gear) that can be mixed and matched. The product line would be designed with sustainability in mind, using biobased materials and easy-to-repair components. This innovation would cater to both beginner and serious athletes who seek flexibility and long-term value in their sports equipment.

## Actionability

- Conduct customer research with beginner and serious athletes to identify key customization needs
- Partner with biobased material suppliers to develop sustainable modular components
- Prototype modular designs for at least two sports categories (e.g., cycling, hiking)
- Develop a repair guide and training program for store staff to support modular gear maintenance

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt this system for different skill levels, from beginners to professionals?
2. Which sports categories would benefit most from modularity and why?
3. What partnerships could accelerate the development and adoption of this modular system?
