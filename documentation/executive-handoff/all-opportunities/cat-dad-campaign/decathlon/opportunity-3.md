# Elite Tech, Real Prices Campaign

## Description

Execute a marketing campaign titled 'Elite Tech, Real Prices' to challenge the 'Performance = Premium' stereotype in the running category. The campaign will highlight Decathlon's technical innovations (e.g., RHEON LABS materials) and demonstrate how these advancements are available at mass-market prices. The campaign will use comparative advertising, in-store demonstrations, and athlete endorsements to showcase the affordability and performance of Decathlon's running gear. This initiative aims to attract price-sensitive performance seekers and increase market share in the running category.

## Actionability

- Develop a series of comparative ads showcasing Kiprun running tights vs premium brands
- Create in-store 'Performance Lab' zones for live material science demonstrations
- Partner with amateur running clubs to sponsor athletes using Decathlon gear
- Launch the campaign across digital, social, and in-store channels

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt this campaign for other sports categories (e.g., cycling, hiking)?
2. What additional in-store experiences could reinforce the campaign message?
3. How can we measure the campaign's impact on brand perception and sales?
