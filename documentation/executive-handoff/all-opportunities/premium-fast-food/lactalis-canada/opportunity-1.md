# Heritage Cheese Subscription Box

## Description

Launch a premium subscription box featuring rotating selections of Lactalis Canada's heritage cheeses like Cracker Barrel and Balderson, paired with artisan Canadian accompaniments (e.g., local honey, crackers). Each box would include storytelling cards about the cheese-making process and dairy farm heritage. This taps into the growing demand for curated food experiences while leveraging the brand's 140-year history. The subscription model creates recurring revenue and deepens engagement with premium customers who value authenticity and Canadian craftsmanship.

## Actionability

- Conduct a 4-week pilot with 200 premium customers to test box contents and pricing tiers
- Partner with 3 Canadian artisan food producers for initial box collaborations
- Develop storytelling content with dairy farmers for inclusion in first boxes

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we incorporate virtual farm tours or cheesemaker Q&As as premium subscriber benefits?
2. What seasonal themes could make each box feel uniquely Canadian throughout the year?
