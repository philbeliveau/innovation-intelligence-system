# Dairy-Powered Athlete Collective

## Description

Create an endorsement collective of Canadian Olympic and professional athletes who fuel with Lactalis Canada's high-protein dairy products. Unlike individual sponsorships, this program would feature diverse athletes across sports united by their use of products like Astro high-protein yogurt. The partnership reinforces the nutritional benefits of dairy protein while aligning with the brand's Canadian heritage. It targets health-conscious consumers and fitness enthusiasts who seek authentic performance nutrition.

## Actionability

- Identify and contract 5-7 Canadian athletes across winter/summer sports for inaugural collective
- Develop co-branded content series showing athletes' training fueled by Lactalis products
- Create limited-edition athlete-inspired product variants (e.g., 'Olympian Protein Blend' yogurt)

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we leverage this collective to create community fitness events?
2. What performance metrics could we track to demonstrate real nutritional benefits?
