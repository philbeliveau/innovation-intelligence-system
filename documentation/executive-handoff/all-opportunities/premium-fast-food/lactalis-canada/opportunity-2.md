# Zero-Waste Dairy Refill Stations

## Description

Pilot in-store refill stations for Lactalis Canada's milk and yogurt in reusable containers at premium grocery partners. Customers bring clean containers or purchase branded glass jars to fill with fresh product, reducing packaging waste. This service aligns with the brand's ESG leadership goals while creating a premium, sustainable shopping experience. It particularly appeals to organic-focused parents and sustainability-conscious consumers who prioritize reducing household waste.

## Actionability

- Partner with 2 premium grocery chains (e.g., Whole Foods, Loblaws) for 3-month pilot
- Design and test hygienic refill station prototypes with food safety engineers
- Develop branded glass containers with deposit return system to encourage reuse
