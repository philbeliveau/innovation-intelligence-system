# Dairy Farm Transparency Live Streams

## Description

Launch 24/7 live streams from partner dairy farms showing sustainable practices and animal care, accessible via the brand website and social platforms. This always-on transparency initiative builds trust with consumers concerned about food origins, particularly organic-focused parents and ESG-conscious shoppers. The streams would highlight the brand's sustainability commitments while creating engaging, authentic content that differentiates from competitors' polished marketing.

## Actionability

- Install streaming equipment at 3 partner farms representing different regions
- Develop content calendar highlighting seasonal farming milestones (calving, harvest, etc.)
- Create interactive elements allowing viewers to submit questions for farmer Q&As

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we package highlights from these streams for broader social media distribution?
2. What educational overlays or data could we add to enhance the transparency value?
