# Cheese Board Generator AR App

## Description

Develop an augmented reality mobile app that helps users create perfect cheese boards using Lactalis Canada products. The app would use smartphone cameras to scan available space, suggest arrangements based on cheese types (leveraging Cracker Barrel and Balderson varieties), and provide pairing recommendations. This digital experience enhances entertaining occasions while showcasing the brand's premium products in social settings. It particularly targets urban foodies and flexitarians who frequently host gatherings.

## Actionability

- Prototype core AR functionality using existing platforms like Apple's ARKit
- Conduct user testing with 50 food enthusiasts to refine interface and features
- Partner with 3 Canadian wine/spirit brands for cross-promoted pairing suggestions

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we integrate this with e-commerce for instant product ordering?
2. What social sharing features would maximize organic promotion among foodie communities?
