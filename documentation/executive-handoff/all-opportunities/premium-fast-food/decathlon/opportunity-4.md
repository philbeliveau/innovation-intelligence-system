# Augmented Reality Equipment Fitting Stations

## Description

Install AR kiosks in flagship stores that overlay digital equipment (bikes, kayaks, tents) onto customers' bodies/spaces to visualize fit and function. This addresses beginner athletes' uncertainty about gear selection while showcasing Decathlon's technical expertise. The innovation leverages store modernization budgets and creates Instagrammable moments that drive foot traffic.

## Actionability

- Partner with AR startup to adapt existing retail tech for sports equipment
- Design 3 key demo scenarios (bike sizing, tent capacity, paddleboard stability)
- Train staff as 'AR Guides' to facilitate the experience

## Visual

*A customer laughing as they see themselves digitally paddling a kayak in a store aisle, with specs floating alongside.*

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How could we extend this experience to home use via mobile app?
2. What performance data could we capture during AR sessions?
