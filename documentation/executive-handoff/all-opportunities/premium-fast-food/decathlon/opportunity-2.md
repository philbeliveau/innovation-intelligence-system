# Sports Gear Subscription Box Service

## Description

Launch a 'Decathlon Discovery Box' subscription service that delivers seasonal sports equipment bundles (e.g., summer paddleboarding kit, winter trail running gear) with expert tutorials. This creates recurring revenue while introducing customers to new sports, addressing casual enthusiasts' desire for novelty. The service leverages Decathlon's broad product assortment and aligns with digital transformation priorities.

## Actionability

- Analyze sales data to identify 6 high-potential seasonal sport bundles
- Develop digital content framework for accompanying tutorial videos
- Pilot test with 500 UK customers using existing logistics infrastructure

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How could we integrate circular services (rentals/returns) into subscription flows?
2. What community features would make subscribers feel part of a sports tribe?
