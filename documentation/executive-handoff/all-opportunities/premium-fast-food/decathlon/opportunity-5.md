# Van Rysel Pro Athlete Takeover Campaign

## Description

Execute a digital campaign where elite cyclists using Van Rysel gear 'take over' Decathlon's social channels with behind-the-scenes training content. This premiumizes the brand through authentic athlete storytelling while remaining accessible - addressing both premiumization and digital transformation goals. The approach mirrors successful influencer strategies in premium sportswear but at Decathlon's value position.

## Actionability

- Secure 3 European pro cyclists as brand ambassadors
- Produce 30-day content calendar mixing live and pre-recorded athlete footage
- Develop performance tracking overlays to highlight gear technology

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we involve local cycling clubs in the takeover events?
2. What limited-edition product could we launch exclusively through this campaign?
