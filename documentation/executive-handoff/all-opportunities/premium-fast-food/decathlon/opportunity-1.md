# Performance-Enhanced Modular Running Shoes

## Description

Develop a new line of Kalenji running shoes with interchangeable components (cushioning, arch support, traction) that can be customized for different running styles and terrains. This addresses the needs of beginner and intermediate runners who want personalized performance without premium prices. Decathlon's vertical integration allows cost-effective modular design, leveraging insights about budget-conscious athletes seeking individualized solutions.

## Actionability

- Conduct focus groups with casual runners to identify top 3 customization needs
- Partner with Decathlon's in-house materials lab to develop swappable sole units
- Prototype 3 modular configurations using existing Kalenji shoe platforms

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we make the customization process intuitive for first-time runners?
2. What subscription model could support ongoing component upgrades?
