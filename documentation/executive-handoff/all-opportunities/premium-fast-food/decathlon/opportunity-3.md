# Second Life Certified Reseller Program

## Description

Create a certified reseller network for Decathlon's refurbished Second Life products through partnerships with local sports clubs and schools. Clubs earn commissions selling refurbished gear while promoting sustainable sports participation. This accelerates circular sales growth targets while strengthening community ties - addressing both sustainability and market expansion priorities.

## Actionability

- Identify 20 pilot partner organizations in target UK/India markets
- Develop training materials for partners on Second Life product benefits
- Create co-branded marketing assets highlighting community impact stories

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we gamify participation to create friendly competition between clubs?
2. What data should we capture to prove the environmental impact?
