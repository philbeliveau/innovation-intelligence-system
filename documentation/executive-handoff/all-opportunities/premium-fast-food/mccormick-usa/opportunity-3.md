# Sustainable Packaging Loyalty Program

## Description

Launch a loyalty program that rewards customers for returning empty McCormick spice jars and packaging for recycling.

This program reinforces McCormickâ€™s commitment to sustainability while engaging eco-conscious consumers.

## Actionability

- Design a streamlined process for collecting and recycling returned packaging.
- Develop a digital platform to track customer points and rewards.
- Create marketing materials to promote the program through social media and packaging inserts.
- Launch a pilot program in select regions to test logistics and customer response.
