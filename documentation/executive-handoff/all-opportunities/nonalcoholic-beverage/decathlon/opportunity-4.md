# Second Life Subscription Service

## Description

Introduce a subscription service for Decathlon's Second Life refurbished products, allowing customers to rotate through seasonal sports equipment. Members could exchange used bikes in winter for ski gear, then back to camping equipment in summer, all professionally maintained by Decathlon.

This innovative circular economy experience provides budget-conscious customers access to quality gear while ensuring maximum product utilization. It transforms Decathlon's sustainability efforts from one-off transactions to ongoing relationships.

The service builds directly on Decathlon's circular economy leadership and digital transformation priorities. It creates a predictable revenue stream while advancing the brand's 6-10x circular sales growth target.

## Actionability

- Map seasonal equipment demand patterns across 3 test markets
- Develop refurbishment capacity planning for subscription volume
- Design digital platform for subscription management and exchanges
- Pilot with 500 cycling and winter sports enthusiasts in the Alps region
