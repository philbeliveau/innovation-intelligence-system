# Community Sport Leader Program

## Description

Launch a certified Community Sport Leader program that trains and equips local enthusiasts to host regular sport activities using Decathlon equipment. Partner with municipal parks departments and community centers to establish these free weekly events in parking lots and public spaces near Decathlon stores.

This initiative would strengthen Decathlon's community hub positioning while driving equipment trial and sales. It provides structured entry points for beginners and creates recurring engagement opportunities that competitors can't easily replicate.

The program leverages Decathlon's existing event expertise and store footprint. It aligns perfectly with the brand's accessibility mission and multi-sensory retail insights by creating real-world product experiences beyond store walls.

## Actionability

- Pilot program with 5 UK stores partnering with local councils
- Develop certification curriculum for 3 starter sports (running, football, yoga)
- Create equipment lending kits with Kipsta, Kalenji, and Domyos products
- Implement tracking system to measure participant-to-customer conversion

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we scale this program in markets with different community structures?
2. What incentives would motivate both participants and leaders to sustain engagement?
