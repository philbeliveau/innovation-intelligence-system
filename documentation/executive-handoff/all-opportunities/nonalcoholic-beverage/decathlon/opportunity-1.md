# AI-Powered Sport Coaching App

## Description

Develop an AI-powered mobile app that provides personalized sport coaching and equipment recommendations based on user goals, skill level, and progress tracking. The app would integrate with Decathlon's product ecosystem, suggesting Kalenji running gear for beginners or Van Rysel cycling equipment for advanced athletes, while offering tailored workout plans.

This service aligns perfectly with Decathlon's digital transformation and accessibility mission, helping beginners overcome intimidation and serious athletes optimize performance. It creates a sticky digital touchpoint that drives both equipment sales and brand loyalty.

The opportunity leverages Decathlon's e-commerce platform modernization and broad product range. AI personalization was identified as a key strategic insight, and this app would be a natural extension of the 'Sport Finder' concept with added coaching functionality.

## Actionability

- Partner with an AI fitness coaching platform to license their technology
- Conduct user testing with 3 key segments: beginners, casual enthusiasts, and serious athletes
- Develop MVP integrating 3 sport categories (running, cycling, fitness) with Decathlon product catalog
- Create incentive system linking app achievements to in-store rewards
