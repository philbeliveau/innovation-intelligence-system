# Performance Guarantee Campaign

## Description

Launch a bold 'Performance Guaranteed' marketing campaign where Decathlon promises its Kiprun, Kipsta, and Van Rysel products will meet or exceed premium competitors' performance at 30-50% lower prices - or customers get the difference refunded. The campaign would use side-by-side lab tests and athlete testimonials to prove the value proposition.

This aggressive positioning directly addresses the paradox of affordable performance that serious budget-conscious athletes face. It creates a powerful differentiator that leverages Decathlon's vertical integration advantages while reinforcing its accessibility mission.

The campaign builds on the paradox resolution insight and Decathlon's partnerships with RHEON LABS and UEFA. It provides a concrete way to communicate the brand's technical capabilities to performance-focused segments.

## Actionability

- Conduct independent lab testing on 5 key products versus premium competitors
- Develop refund claim process integrated with POS systems
- Create athlete ambassador program featuring budget-conscious serious athletes
- Launch phased campaign starting with running and cycling categories

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we extend this guarantee to team sports equipment purchases?
2. What metrics should we track to ensure the campaign drives profitable sales growth?
