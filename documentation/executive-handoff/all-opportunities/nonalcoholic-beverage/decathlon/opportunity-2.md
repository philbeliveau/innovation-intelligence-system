# Modular Camping System

## Description

Create a modular Quechua camping system where tents, sleeping bags, and cooking equipment can be mixed, matched, and expanded as families grow or needs change. The system would use standardized connection points and materials to ensure compatibility across products and seasons.

This innovation directly serves Decathlon's family and beginner segments who value flexibility and long-term value. It reduces decision fatigue for first-time campers while encouraging repeat purchases as needs evolve.

The concept builds on the occasion-centric bundles insight while adding a sustainable dimension through upgradability. Decathlon's vertical integration makes it uniquely positioned to execute this system approach across multiple product categories.

## Actionability

- Conduct ethnographic research with family campers to identify pain points in equipment scaling
- Prototype 3 modular connection systems with Quechua product designers
- Develop cross-category compatibility standards for tents, sleeping bags, and cooking gear
- Create marketing materials showing system flexibility across family life stages

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we incorporate circular economy principles into the modular design?
2. What pricing strategy would maximize both initial adoption and subsequent add-on purchases?
