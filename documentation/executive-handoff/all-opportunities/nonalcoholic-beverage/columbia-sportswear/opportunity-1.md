# Scent-Infused Outdoor Gear Collection

## Description

This opportunity involves developing a new line of scent-infused outdoor gear that evokes the sensory experiences of nature. Products like Omni-Heat jackets, hiking socks, and base layers could be infused with subtle scents like campfire, pine, or fresh rain, enhancing emotional connections with outdoor activities. The scents would be designed to be long-lasting yet not overpowering, adding a unique layer of engagement to Columbia’s high-performance gear. This aligns with the brand’s focus on multi-sensory experiences and its 'Engineered for Whatever' platform, which emphasizes resilience and authenticity. By integrating this innovation, Columbia can deepen emotional engagement with core outdoor enthusiasts and casual participants, making its products more memorable and differentiated in a competitive market.

## Actionability

- Partner with a fragrance expert to develop natural, long-lasting scents that evoke outdoor experiences.
- Prototype scent-infused jackets and socks using Omni-Heat and moisture-wicking technologies.
- Conduct focus groups with core outdoor enthusiasts to validate scent preferences and emotional impact.
- Test market the collection in select retail stores and online, measuring customer feedback and sales performance.
