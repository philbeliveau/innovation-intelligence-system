# Interactive Trail Maps in Retail Stores

## Description

This opportunity involves integrating interactive trail maps into Columbia’s retail stores, enhancing the in-store experience for customers. These digital maps would allow customers to explore local hiking and adventure routes, with gear recommendations tailored to each trail’s conditions. For example, a customer planning a summer hike in the Rockies could see recommended products like UV-protective shirts and hydration packs. This aligns with Columbia’s wholesale growth strategy by driving foot traffic and increasing in-store dwell time. It also bridges the gap between digital and physical channels, offering a unique, value-added experience that competitors like The North Face do not provide.

## Actionability

- Partner with a mapping software provider to develop interactive trail maps for key regions.
- Install touchscreen displays in select retail stores, integrating them with product inventory systems.
- Train staff to use the maps to guide customers toward relevant gear and accessories.
- Promote the feature through in-store signage and social media campaigns.
