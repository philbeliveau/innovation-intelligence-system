# Circular Outdoor Collection Launch

## Description

This opportunity involves launching a fully recyclable Circular Outdoor Collection in partnership with a leading recycling company. The collection would feature products like Omni-Heat jackets and Omni-Shield pants made from recycled materials, with a take-back program that allows customers to return worn items for recycling. This aligns with Columbia’s sustainability commitments and addresses its lag in transparency compared to competitors like Patagonia. By partnering with a recycling expert, Columbia can ensure the technical performance of its products while minimizing environmental impact. This initiative would appeal to eco-conscious consumers and strengthen Columbia’s reputation as a leader in sustainable outdoor gear.

## Actionability

- Partner with a recycling company to develop fully recyclable materials for Omni-Heat and Omni-Shield products.
- Design a take-back program infrastructure for collecting and processing returned gear.
- Launch the collection with a marketing campaign highlighting its environmental benefits and technical performance.
- Collaborate with retail partners to promote the collection and facilitate returns.
