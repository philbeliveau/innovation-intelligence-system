# Interactive Farm-to-Table AR Packaging

## Description

This opportunity involves integrating augmented reality (AR) into Lactalis Canada’s product packaging to create immersive storytelling experiences. For example, Black Diamond Cheestrings could feature AR-enabled packaging that, when scanned with a smartphone, shows animated farm-to-table journeys or interactive games for kids. This innovation leverages Lactalis Canada’s heritage and premium positioning to deepen customer engagement and differentiate the brand in the competitive dairy market.

## Actionability

- Partner with an AR development firm to create a prototype for Black Diamond Cheestrings.
- Conduct focus groups with families to validate the appeal of AR storytelling.
- Develop QR codes linking to AR experiences and test them on a small batch of packaging.
- Collaborate with Canadian dairy farmers to create authentic farm-to-table videos.
