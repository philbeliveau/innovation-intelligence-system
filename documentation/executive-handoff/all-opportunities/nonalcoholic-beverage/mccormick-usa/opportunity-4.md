# Hot Sauce Mixology Kits

## Description

Create limited-edition cocktail/beverage kits featuring Frank's RedHot and Cholula sauces paired with premium mixers and recipes for spicy drinks. Market these through specialty food retailers and direct-to-consumer channels with a focus on the growing 'spicy beverage' trend.

This marketing innovation expands usage occasions for McCormick's hot sauce brands beyond food, tapping into the $7B craft cocktail market. It targets adventurous Millennial consumers who enjoy flavor experimentation and social sharing of unique culinary experiences.

The concept leverages McCormick's recent hot sauce flavor expansions and aligns with the non-alcoholic beverage trend from the input source. It can be quickly executed using existing products with new packaging and marketing positioning.

## Actionability

- Develop 3 signature spicy cocktail recipes with mixologists featuring Frank's and Cholula
- Partner with 2 premium mixer brands for co-branded kits (e.g., Fever-Tree, Q Mixers)
- Create social media campaign featuring bartenders creating the drinks with UGC potential
- Secure placement in 3 specialty retailers (e.g., Williams Sonoma, Sur La Table)

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How could we extend this concept to non-alcoholic spicy beverages for health-conscious consumers?
2. What seasonal variations could keep this offering fresh throughout the year?
