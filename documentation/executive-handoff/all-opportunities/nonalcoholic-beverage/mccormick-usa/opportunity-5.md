# Chef-Designed Restaurant Spice Blends

## Description

Collaborate with celebrity chefs to create exclusive, restaurant-quality spice blends sold through grocery and McCormick's e-commerce channels. Each blend would be inspired by the chef's signature dishes, with portion of proceeds supporting culinary education programs.

This partnership innovation strengthens McCormick's foodservice presence while bringing professional flavors to home cooks. It creates premium products that can command higher margins while building authentic connections with culinary enthusiasts.

The opportunity aligns perfectly with McCormick's strategy to reduce retail dependency through foodservice expansion. It builds on their existing chef relationships and can leverage McCormick's rapid innovation capabilities to bring products to market quickly.

## Actionability

- Identify 3 high-profile chef partners with distinct culinary styles (e.g., Mexican, BBQ, plant-based)
- Develop 2 blends per chef using McCormick's AI flavor tools to scale their signature flavors
- Create co-branded marketing materials featuring chef stories and recipe inspirations
- Structure charitable component with culinary schools for maximum impact and PR value
