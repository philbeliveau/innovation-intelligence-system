# Sustainable Spice Refill Stations

## Description

Install in-store refill stations for popular McCormick spices at major grocery retailers, allowing customers to refill reusable containers. The stations would feature premium, sustainably sourced spices with digital displays showing origin stories and recipe ideas.

This innovation supports McCormick's 2025 sustainability goals while creating a premium, tactile shopping experience. It appeals to eco-conscious consumers (particularly Millennials and Gen Z) who want to reduce packaging waste but don't want to compromise on quality or convenience.

The concept builds on McCormick's Â£11.3M packaging investment and aligns with growing consumer demand for sustainable options. Pilot testing could leverage McCormick's existing retail relationships and be implemented alongside their current packaging modernization program.

## Actionability

- Identify 3 pilot retail partners with strong sustainability commitments (e.g., Whole Foods, Wegmans)
- Design refill station prototype with modular spice dispensers and digital interface showing product origins
- Develop branded, reusable spice containers for purchase at station
- Create training program for store staff on station operation and maintenance

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How could we gamify the refill experience to encourage repeat usage?
2. What premium pricing model would justify the operational costs while remaining attractive to consumers?
