# AI-Powered Flavor Subscription Box

## Description

Launch a subscription service that uses AI to curate personalized spice blends and recipes based on individual taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and cooking habits. Each month, subscribers receive a box with 2-3 custom spice blends, recipe cards, and access to exclusive digital content like cooking tutorials and flavor profiles.

This service directly addresses McCormick's strategic priority of digital transformation and leverages their existing AI capabilities with IBM. It creates a recurring revenue stream while deepening engagement with home cooks and health-conscious consumers who value personalization and convenience.

The opportunity builds on McCormick's Flavor of the Year platform and e-commerce optimization efforts. The AI foundation already exists through their IBM partnership, making this a feasible near-term innovation that can be scaled quickly.

## Actionability

- Develop MVP with IBM using existing AI flavor algorithms to create 3 prototype subscription tiers (beginner, adventurous, health-focused)
- Conduct 1:1 interviews with 50 target customers (25-45yo home cooks) to validate subscription price points and content preferences
- Partner with a fulfillment center specializing in food subscriptions to handle logistics
- Create 3 sample monthly boxes with different theme concepts (global flavors, seasonal, functional benefits)
