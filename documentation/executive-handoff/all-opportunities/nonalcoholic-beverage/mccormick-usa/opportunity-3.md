# Flavor Explorer AR Cooking App

## Description

Develop an augmented reality mobile app that helps users explore global flavors through interactive cooking experiences. The app would use AR to guide users through recipes, show spice origins via 3D maps, and suggest flavor substitutions based on what's in their pantry.

This product innovation taps into growing interest in ethnic cuisine exploration (especially among Millennials and Gen Z) while leveraging McCormick's flavor expertise. It creates a sticky digital touchpoint that drives both online and offline engagement with McCormick products.

The app builds directly on McCormick's digital transformation strategy and recent experiments with AR (like QR codes on packaging). It can be developed using existing McCormick recipe content and flavor pairing algorithms from their AI initiatives.

## Actionability

- Partner with an AR development studio to create MVP focusing on 3 signature recipes (e.g., Aji Amarillo dish)
- Integrate with McCormick's existing recipe database and flavor pairing algorithms
- Test prototype with 100 users from McCormick's online cooking communities
- Develop monetization strategy through premium features and in-app purchases

## Visual

*A smartphone screen showing the AR interface in action - a kitchen counter with virtual spice jars that animate when selected, showing flavor profiles and recipe steps overlayed on the real world.*

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How could we use this app to gather unique consumer insights about flavor preferences?
2. What partnerships with cooking influencers or culinary schools could amplify adoption?
