# Partnership with Local Sports Clubs

## Description

This opportunity involves partnering with local sports clubs and organizations to co-host community events, such as running clubs or climbing workshops, at Decathlon stores. These partnerships enhance Decathlon’s community engagement, drive foot traffic, and position stores as local sports hubs. They also provide opportunities to showcase Decathlon equipment and services.

## Actionability

- Identify local sports clubs and organizations in key Decathlon markets.
- Develop a partnership framework outlining roles, responsibilities, and benefits.
- Plan and co-host a pilot event with a local running club or climbing group.
- Promote events through Decathlon’s app, website, and social media channels.
- Evaluate event success based on attendance and customer feedback.
