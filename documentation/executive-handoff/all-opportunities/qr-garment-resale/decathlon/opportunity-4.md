# Interactive Sustainability Experience in Stores

## Description

This opportunity transforms Decathlon stores into interactive hubs where customers can learn about sustainability through hands-on experiences, such as repair workshops, product lifecycle displays, and circular economy kiosks. This enhances the in-store experience, educates customers on Decathlonâ€™s sustainability efforts, and drives engagement with Second Life products.

## Actionability

- Design interactive displays showcasing product lifecycle and circular economy initiatives.
- Train store staff to conduct repair workshops and sustainability tours.
- Install circular economy kiosks where customers can browse Second Life products.
- Launch the experience in flagship stores and measure customer engagement.
- Promote the initiative through in-store signage and digital channels.
