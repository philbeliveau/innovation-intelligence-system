# Sports Equipment Subscription Service

## Description

This opportunity proposes a subscription service for high-value sports equipment, such as B’Twin bikes and Simond climbing gear, allowing customers to rent and rotate products monthly.

- Develop a logistics plan for equipment delivery, pickup, and maintenance.
- Integrate subscription management into the Decathlon app and website.
