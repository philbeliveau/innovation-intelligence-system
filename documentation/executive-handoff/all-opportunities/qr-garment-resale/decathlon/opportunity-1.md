# Modular Sports Equipment Design

## Description

This opportunity involves designing modular sports equipment, such as Kiprun running shoes and Van Rysel cycling gear, with interchangeable components for easy repair, upgrade, and recycling. By embedding modularity into product design, Decathlon can extend product lifecycles, reduce waste, and appeal to eco-conscious consumers. This aligns with Decathlonâ€™s sustainability goals and circular economy initiatives, leveraging its vertical integration to innovate in product design.

## Actionability

- Conduct focus groups with eco-conscious customers to identify key modular features.
- Partner with BioCircular Materials Alliance members to source sustainable materials.
- Develop prototypes of modular running shoes and cycling gear for testing.
- Create repair guides and disassembly instructions for modular products.
- Launch a pilot program in select markets to validate customer adoption.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we scale modular design across other product categories?
2. What partnerships could accelerate the development of modular components?
3. How can we communicate the value of modularity to budget-conscious customers?
