# AI-Powered Flavor Subscription Box

## Description

Develop a subscription box service that leverages McCormick’s AI partnership with IBM Research to deliver personalized spice blends tailored to individual dietary preferences and cooking habits. Each box would include curated spice blends, recipe cards, and tips for maximizing flavor at home. This innovation aligns with McCormick’s strategic priority of accelerating innovation cycles with AI and meeting the growing demand for personalized nutrition. By offering a convenient, tailored solution, McCormick can deepen engagement with health-conscious consumers and drive recurring revenue through subscriptions.

- Partner with IBM Research to refine AI algorithms for flavor recommendation accuracy.
- Prototype subscription box packaging and contents using existing spice blends.
- Launch a pilot program with 500 subscribers to test pricing and customer satisfaction.
