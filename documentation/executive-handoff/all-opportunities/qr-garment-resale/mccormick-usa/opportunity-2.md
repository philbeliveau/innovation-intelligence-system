# Circular Kitchen Recycling Campaign

## Description

Launch a marketing campaign called 'Circular Kitchen' to educate consumers on sustainable cooking practices using McCormick products. The campaign would highlight McCormick’s commitment to sustainability and encourage consumers to recycle spice jars through QR codes on packaging linked to recycling guides and incentives. This initiative transforms McCormick’s £11.3M sustainable packaging investment into a branded experience, resonating with eco-conscious consumers and aligning with the brand’s net-zero emissions target. By positioning McCormick as a leader in sustainability, the campaign can enhance brand loyalty and drive premium product sales.

## Actionability

- Design QR codes linking to recycling guides and incentives for packaging.
- Develop a 'Circular Kitchen' microsite with educational content and recycling tips.
- Partner with eco-conscious influencers to amplify the campaign’s reach.
- Launch a pilot program in key markets to measure consumer engagement and recycling rates.
