# Regional Flavor Festivals

## Description

Host 'Flavor Festivals' in key markets to showcase McCormick’s regionalized flavor offerings and engage multicultural households. These festivals would feature cooking demonstrations by local chefs, product sampling, and interactive experiences tailored to regional culinary traditions. This initiative leverages McCormick’s Flavor of the Year platform and its portfolio of authentic ethnic brands to create emotional connections with consumers. By bringing McCormick’s flavors to life in a festive, experiential format, the brand can drive awareness, trial, and loyalty among ethnic cuisine enthusiasts.

## Actionability

- Identify key markets and regions for the initial Flavor Festivals.
- Partner with local chefs and food influencers to curate festival experiences.
- Develop festival-specific recipes using McCormick products.
- Launch a pilot festival in a high-potential market (e.g., Houston for Latin American flavors).

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt Flavor Festivals for virtual or hybrid formats?
2. What additional partnerships (e.g., local food vendors) could enhance the festival experience?
3. How can we measure the festivals’ impact on brand awareness and sales?
