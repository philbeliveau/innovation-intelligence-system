# Columbia Outdoor Community App

## Description

Develop a Columbia-branded outdoor community app where customers can share trail guides, gear reviews, and outdoor experiences. This digital platform fosters year-round engagement, complementing Columbia’s experiential events like the China Hike Party. Features include trail maps, gear recommendations, user-generated content, and integration with Strava for activity tracking. The app gamifies participation by offering rewards like discounts for contributions and milestones. This innovation deepens customer engagement and strengthens brand loyalty while differentiating Columbia from competitors focused solely on product performance. The feasibility is supported by Columbia’s existing digital infrastructure and the growing demand for outdoor community platforms.

## Actionability

- Prototype an app with trail maps, gear recommendations, and Strava integration.
- Gamify user participation with rewards like discounts and branded merchandise.
- Launch a pilot version with Columbia’s core customer segments.
- Market the app through social media and experiential events.
