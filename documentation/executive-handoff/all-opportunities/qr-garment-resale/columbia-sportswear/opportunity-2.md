# Columbia Gear Rental Subscription Service

## Description

Launch a rental subscription service for Columbia’s modular gear, such as the Whirlibird IV Interchange jackets and Titanium hiking apparel. This service caters to occasional outdoor users and sustainability-conscious consumers who prefer access over ownership. Customers can rent gear for specific trips or seasons, reducing the barrier to entry for outdoor activities. This innovation aligns with Columbia’s modular systems and consumer value focus while addressing the shift toward circular economy models. It leverages Columbia’s existing product portfolio and operational capabilities to create a new revenue stream. The feasibility is supported by the growing popularity of rental services in the outdoor industry.

## Actionability

- Develop a pilot rental program for modular jackets and hiking gear.
- Partner with outdoor retailers to offer in-store rental options.
- Create a digital platform for managing subscriptions and gear returns.
- Market the service to occasional outdoor users and eco-conscious consumers.
