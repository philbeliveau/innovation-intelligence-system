# Smart Omni-Heat Apparel with Biometric Sensors

## Description

Integrate Omni-Heat technology with wearable biometric sensors to create smart apparel that monitors body temperature and adjusts insulation dynamically. This innovation leverages Columbia’s NASA-validated Omni-Heat technology to develop a line of smart jackets and base layers. These products would connect to a mobile app, allowing users to optimize their comfort in real-time during outdoor activities or urban commutes. This innovation addresses the growing demand for tech-enhanced outdoor gear and positions Columbia as a leader in smart apparel. It leverages Columbia’s existing credibility in extreme performance technologies and aligns with its 'Engineered for Whatever' ethos. The feasibility is supported by Columbia’s NASA partnership and the increasing accessibility of wearable sensor technology.

## Actionability

- Prototype a smart Omni-Heat jacket with embedded biometric sensors.
- Partner with a wearable tech company to integrate sensor technology.
- Develop a mobile app for real-time temperature adjustment and data tracking.
- Conduct user testing with winter sports enthusiasts and urban active lifestyle consumers.
