# Hyper-Local Sustainability Rewards Program

## Description

Create a hyper-local sustainability rewards program where customers earn discounts or rewards for recycling Columbia gear at local retailers or participating in community clean-up events. This program reinforces Columbia’s Land Trust Alliance partnership and conservation commitments while engaging local communities. Customers can bring used Columbia gear to participating retailers for recycling and receive discounts on new purchases. Additionally, Columbia could sponsor community clean-up events, offering branded rewards for participants. This innovation aligns with Columbia’s outdoor authenticity and sustainability focus, enhancing brand loyalty and community engagement. The feasibility is supported by Columbia’s existing partnerships and localized marketing efforts.

## Actionability

- Partner with local outdoor retailers to launch recycling drop-off points.
- Develop a rewards system for recycling and clean-up participation.
- Market the program through local events and social media campaigns.
- Collaborate with Land Trust Alliance to sponsor community clean-up events.
