# Circularity Partnership with Resale Platforms

## Description

Partner with resale platforms like ThredUp or Poshmark to create a branded Columbia resale marketplace. This partnership enables customers to buy, sell, and recycle Columbia gear seamlessly, embedding circularity into the brand’s lifecycle. Columbia can pre-populate the marketplace with product details like Omni-Heat specs and care guides, ensuring authenticity and quality. This innovation aligns with Columbia’s sustainability initiatives and conservation commitments while addressing consumer interest in circular economy models. It leverages Columbia’s existing product portfolio and operational capabilities to create a new revenue stream. The feasibility is supported by the growing popularity of resale platforms and Columbia’s 2024 recycled materials initiative.

## Actionability

- Partner with a resale platform to launch a branded Columbia marketplace.
- Pre-populate the marketplace with product details and care guides.
- Market the resale platform through Columbia’s website and social media.
- Integrate QR codes into product tags linking to the resale platform.
