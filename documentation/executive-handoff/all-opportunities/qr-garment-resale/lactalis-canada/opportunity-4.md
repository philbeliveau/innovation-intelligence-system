# Interactive Carbon Footprint Tracker

## Description

Lactalis Canada can introduce an interactive carbon footprint tracker on its website, allowing customers to see the environmental impact of their purchases. The tracker would provide personalized tips for reducing their carbon footprint, such as recipes using leftover cheese or yogurt. This experience would engage eco-conscious consumers, particularly flexitarians and organic-focused parents, and reinforce Lactalis Canada’s sustainability leadership. The initiative leverages the brand’s ESG achievements and digital transformation focus.

## Actionability

- Develop a prototype of the carbon footprint tracker using existing product data.
- Partner with a sustainability consulting firm to validate the tracker’s accuracy.
- Promote the tracker through email campaigns and social media.
- Monitor customer feedback to refine the tool.
