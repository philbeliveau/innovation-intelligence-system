# Digital Dairy Exchange Platform

## Description

Lactalis Canada can launch a digital platform where customers can exchange unused or surplus dairy products with others in their community. This service would reduce food waste and foster local connections, aligning with the brand’s sustainability and community engagement priorities. The platform would cater to health-conscious families and lactose-intolerant consumers, offering a convenient way to share products like high-protein yogurt or lactose-free cheese. This initiative leverages Lactalis Canada’s digital transformation focus and complements its e-commerce strategy.

## Actionability

- Develop a prototype of the exchange platform integrated with Lactalis Canada’s e-commerce site.
- Partner with local retailers to promote the platform and offer in-store collection points.
- Conduct a pilot test in urban centers like Montreal and Calgary.
- Create a marketing campaign targeting health-conscious families and lactose-intolerant consumers.
