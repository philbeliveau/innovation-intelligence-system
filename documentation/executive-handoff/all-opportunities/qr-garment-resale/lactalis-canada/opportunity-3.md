# Sustainability-Focused Social Media Campaign

## Description

Lactalis Canada can launch a social media campaign highlighting its sustainability achievements, such as the zero-carbon distribution center and packaging lightweighting. The campaign would feature educational content, tips for reducing food waste, and behind-the-scenes looks at sustainable practices. This initiative would appeal to eco-conscious consumers, particularly flexitarians and organic-focused parents, reinforcing Lactalis Canada’s position as a sustainability leader. The campaign leverages the brand’s existing ESG commitments and aligns with its marketing strategy.

## Actionability

- Develop a content calendar featuring sustainability-focused posts.
- Collaborate with influencers in the sustainability and dairy spaces to amplify the campaign.
- Create a hashtag campaign encouraging customers to share their sustainable dairy practices.
- Track engagement metrics to evaluate the campaign’s impact.
