# Reusable Dairy Packaging System

## Description

Lactalis Canada can introduce a reusable packaging system for its products, such as Astro yogurt and Cracker Barrel cheese, where customers return containers for cleaning and reuse. This system would include a deposit-return model to incentivize participation. The initiative would reduce packaging waste and align with the brand’s circular economy goals. This innovation addresses the growing demand for sustainable packaging from eco-conscious consumers, particularly organic-focused parents and flexitarians. It leverages Lactalis Canada’s existing ESG commitments and packaging lightweighting achievements, making it a feasible next step in their sustainability journey.

## Actionability

- Conduct customer research with organic-focused parents to validate interest in reusable packaging.
- Partner with a packaging manufacturer to design durable, reusable containers.
- Pilot the deposit-return system in select urban markets like Toronto and Vancouver.
- Develop a marketing campaign highlighting the environmental benefits of the reusable system.
