# Columbia Gear Swap Community Platform

## Description

Create a digital platform where Columbia customers can buy, sell, or trade used Columbia gear, fostering community engagement while promoting sustainability. This service would include verification of authentic Columbia products and a rating system for transaction reliability. The platform addresses growing consumer interest in sustainability and circular economy models, while creating new touchpoints with the brand. It builds on Columbia's Land Trust Alliance partnership and recycled materials initiative, providing a more tangible sustainability offering that competes with Patagonia's Worn Wear program.

## Actionability

- Develop MVP platform using existing e-commerce infrastructure with basic listing and transaction capabilities
- Partner with authentication experts to create a Columbia gear verification process
- Launch pilot program with 500 loyal customers before public rollout

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we incentivize participation from both sellers and buyers to ensure marketplace liquidity?
2. What value-added services (like cleaning or minor repairs) could we offer to differentiate from general resale platforms?
