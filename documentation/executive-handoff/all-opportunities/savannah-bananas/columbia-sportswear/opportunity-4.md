# Interactive Omni-Tech In-Store Experience

## Description

Develop interactive retail displays that allow customers to physically test Omni-Heat, Omni-Shade, and Omni-Shield technologies in controlled environments. The experience might include temperature-controlled chambers or UV light tests to demonstrate product benefits firsthand. This addresses the need for better product education and differentiation at point of sale, particularly in competitive retail environments. It leverages Columbia's proprietary technologies and NASA validation to create memorable, shareable retail moments that can drive conversion and brand recall.

## Actionability

- Prototype 3 interactive demo concepts in a test store environment
- Train retail staff on technology demonstrations and key talking points
- Develop QR code integration that links to product details and customer reviews

## Visual

*A shopper interacting with an in-store display that simulates cold weather conditions, visibly demonstrating Omni-Heat technology's effectiveness through thermal imaging.*

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt this experience for smaller retail footprints or pop-up activations?
2. What data could we collect from these interactive experiences to inform product development?
