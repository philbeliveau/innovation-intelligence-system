# Outdoor Adventure Storytelling Campaign

## Description

Launch a multi-channel content campaign featuring real customers' outdoor adventures using Columbia gear in extreme conditions, with professional production values and authentic storytelling. The campaign would highlight product performance through compelling narratives rather than traditional product shots. This addresses the need for stronger brand storytelling and emotional connection, particularly among younger outdoor enthusiasts who value authentic experiences over traditional advertising. It leverages Columbia's 'Engineered for Whatever' platform while creating shareable content that can live across digital and social channels.

## Actionability

- Identify and recruit 10 authentic Columbia customers with compelling outdoor stories
- Partner with adventure filmmakers to produce short documentary-style content
- Develop a content calendar for staggered release across Instagram, YouTube, and in-store displays
