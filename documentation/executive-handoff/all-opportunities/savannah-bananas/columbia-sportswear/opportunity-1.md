# Omni-Heat Smart Gloves with Touchscreen Compatibility

## Description

Develop a new line of Omni-Heat gloves with integrated touchscreen-compatible fingertips, addressing a common pain point for outdoor enthusiasts who need to use smartphones in cold weather. The gloves would maintain Columbia's signature thermal performance while adding tech functionality. This product innovation directly serves winter sports enthusiasts and casual outdoor participants who prioritize both warmth and convenience. It leverages Columbia's existing Omni-Heat technology and NASA partnership credibility while addressing the digital experience gap identified in the brand insights.

## Actionability

- Prototype 3 glove designs with varying touchscreen sensitivity levels using existing Omni-Heat materials
- Partner with a touchscreen technology specialist to ensure compatibility across device types
- Test prototypes with China Hike Party participants during winter events for real-world feedback
