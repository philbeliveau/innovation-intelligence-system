# National Parks Co-Branding Initiative

## Description

Create a strategic partnership with the National Park Service to develop co-branded apparel and gear, with a portion of proceeds supporting park conservation efforts. The collection would feature designs inspired by specific parks and built with Columbia's sustainable technologies. This partnership aligns perfectly with Columbia's outdoor heritage and sustainability commitments while creating unique product offerings. It builds on the brand's Land Trust Alliance partnership and can help differentiate Columbia in the competitive outdoor market through authentic, purpose-driven collaborations.

## Actionability

- Initiate conversations with National Park Service representatives about partnership terms
- Design 5 signature pieces featuring iconic park imagery and Columbia technologies
- Plan launch events at key national parks to maximize visibility and media coverage

## Visual

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we extend this partnership beyond products to include educational or volunteer components?
2. What exclusive retail channels (like park visitor centers) could we leverage for distribution?
