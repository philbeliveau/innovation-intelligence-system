# QSR Co-Branded Products

## Description

Co-develop signature retail products with quick-service restaurants (QSRs) to leverage McCormick's Flavor Solutions expertise and reduce retail dependency. Examples include a 'Chick-fil-A Signature Spice Blend' for grocery retail, a 'Chipotle-Inspired' taco seasoning, and limited editions with regional chains like 'Hattie B's Hot Chicken Rub.' This innovation strengthens McCormick's foodservice segment by translating QSR flavors into retail products, reaching new customers and creating buzz. It aligns with the company's strategic priority of foodservice growth and leverages recent Mexico market expansion.

## Actionability

- Identify QSR partners with strong brand recognition and flavor profiles
- Develop co-branded product formulations with QSR chefs
- Launch a marketing campaign highlighting the collaboration
