# Sustainable Flavor Kits

## Description

Launch 'Field to Flavor' sustainable recipe kits that pair McCormick's sustainably sourced spices with seasonal produce. These kits would highlight the origin stories of specific spices, connecting ethical sourcing with flavor authenticity. Each kit would include QR codes for traceability, allowing customers to learn about the farmers and regenerative farming practices behind the spices. This innovation operationalizes McCormick's sustainability commitments by making them tangible and accessible to consumers. It appeals to health-conscious consumers and ethnic cuisine explorers who value transparency and sustainability, while strengthening McCormick's premium positioning.

## Actionability

- Identify key spices with strong sustainability stories for inclusion
- Develop packaging designs with QR codes for traceability
- Partner with local farmers to source seasonal produce for the kits
