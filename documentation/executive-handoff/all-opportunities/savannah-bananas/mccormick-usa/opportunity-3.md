# Flavor Subscription Service

## Description

Introduce a 'McCormick World Flavors Club' subscription service that delivers curated global spice experiences to home cooking enthusiasts. Subscribers would receive quarterly boxes containing premium spices, recipe cards, and access to digital cooking classes. The service would offer tiered memberships, from beginner to chef-level, with exclusive products from brands like Frank's RedHot and Cholula. This innovation leverages McCormick's Flavor of the Year platform and trendspotting capabilities to create a unique flavor discovery experience. It deepens engagement with high-value customers, creates a recurring revenue stream, and differentiates McCormick from competitors.
