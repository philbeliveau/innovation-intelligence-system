# Flavor DNA Quiz

## Description

Develop a digital 'Flavor DNA' quiz that uses AI to analyze customer preferences and dietary needs, recommending personalized McCormick products. This quiz would be integrated into the McCormick website and connected to e-commerce platforms for immediate purchase. The quiz would ask users about their taste preferences, dietary restrictions, and cooking habits, then generate a personalized flavor profile with product recommendations.

It addresses the growing demand for personalized solutions, particularly among health-conscious and ethnic cuisine enthusiasts, while driving digital transformation and increasing basket size.
