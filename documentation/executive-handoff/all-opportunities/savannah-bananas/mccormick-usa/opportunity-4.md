# Functional Spice Blends

## Description

Pilot a 'McCormick Wellness' sub-brand featuring functional spice blends with wellness benefits, such as adaptogenic, probiotic-enhanced, and immunity-boosting ingredients. The initial launch would include three SKUs: turmeric+ginger immunity blend, probiotic taco seasoning, and ashwagandha-infused calming spice. These products would be tested in select Whole Foods regions before a national rollout. This innovation taps into the growing demand for functional foods among health-conscious consumers, leveraging McCormick's AI-powered development capabilities for rapid prototyping. It aligns with the company's volume-led growth priority and captures share in the $23B organic spice market.

## Actionability

- Develop prototypes for the three initial SKUs using AI-powered formulations
- Partner with nutrition influencers for product validation and promotion
- Launch a pilot program in select Whole Foods regions
