# Circular Economy Subscription Service

## Description

Decathlon can launch a subscription service for high-value sports equipment like bikes and fitness gear, allowing customers to rent and return items seamlessly. This service would include maintenance and repair, ensuring that the equipment remains in good condition. By offering a subscription model, Decathlon can make high-quality sports equipment more accessible to a broader audience, including budget-conscious consumers and those who prefer not to own bulky items. This service aligns with Decathlon's commitment to sustainability by promoting the reuse of equipment and reducing waste.

## Actionability

- Develop a pricing model for different subscription tiers based on equipment type and rental duration.
- Create a pilot program in select stores to test the subscription service with a small group of customers.
- Partner with logistics companies to ensure efficient delivery and return of rented equipment.
- Train store associates to promote and manage the subscription service.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we incentivize customers to choose the subscription service over purchasing equipment outright?
2. What additional services could we offer to subscribers to enhance their experience?
3. How can we ensure the sustainability of the equipment throughout its lifecycle?
