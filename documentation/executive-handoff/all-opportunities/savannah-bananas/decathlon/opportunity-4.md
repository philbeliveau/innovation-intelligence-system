# Community Sports Hub Transformation

## Description

Decathlon can transform its large-format stores into community-driven sports hubs, offering year-round events, workshops, and leagues that foster social connections. These hubs would cater to all skill levels and ages, providing a space for people to engage in sports and fitness activities. By emphasizing community engagement, Decathlon can strengthen its role as a facilitator of active lifestyles and create a loyal customer base. This initiative would also increase foot traffic to stores and enhance the overall customer experience.

## Actionability

- Identify the most popular sports and activities in the local community to tailor the events and workshops.
- Partner with local sports organizations and schools to co-create community sports programs.
- Develop a calendar of events and workshops to be promoted through the Decathlon app and in-store signage.
- Train store associates to facilitate and manage the community sports programs.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt the community sports hub concept for smaller store formats?
2. What additional services or amenities could we offer to enhance the community experience?
3. How can we ensure the sustainability of the community sports programs over time?
