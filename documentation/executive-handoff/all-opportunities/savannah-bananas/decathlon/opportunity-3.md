# Sustainability Storytelling Campaign

## Description

Decathlon can amplify its sustainability efforts by crafting compelling narratives around its circular economy initiatives and eco-friendly products. This campaign would highlight the lifecycle of products from creation to Second Life, showcasing Decathlon's commitment to sustainability. The campaign would use various media channels, including social media, in-store displays, and digital content, to educate customers about the benefits of circular services like repairs and rentals. By telling these stories, Decathlon can attract eco-conscious consumers and reinforce its brand values.

## Actionability

- Develop a series of short videos showcasing the lifecycle of Decathlon products, from production to Second Life.
- Create in-store displays that highlight the environmental impact of choosing circular services.
- Launch a social media campaign using the hashtag #DecathlonCircular to engage customers in sustainability conversations.
- Partner with influencers who are passionate about sustainability to promote the campaign.
