# Upcycled Dairy Snack Line

## Description

Lactalis Canada can launch a new product line of upcycled dairy snacks, such as whey protein bars or lactose-based sweeteners, leveraging byproducts from its existing dairy production. This initiative aligns with the brand’s commitment to sustainability and zero-waste goals. The line will appeal to eco-conscious consumers seeking innovative, sustainable food options while reducing production waste. This builds on Lactalis Canada’s circular economy expertise and reinforces its ESG leadership.

## Actionability

- Conduct R&D to develop prototypes for whey protein bars and lactose-based sweeteners.
- Partner with Canadian farmers to source raw materials sustainably.
- Launch a pilot in eco-conscious urban markets like Vancouver and Toronto.
