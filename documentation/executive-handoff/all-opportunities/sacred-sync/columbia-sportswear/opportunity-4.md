# Omni-Tech Sustainability Transparency Campaign

## Description

Launch a marketing campaign that highlights Columbia's sustainability efforts, focusing on the circular Omni-Tech ecosystem and NASA-validated technologies. The campaign would educate consumers on Columbia's commitment to recycled materials, PFC-free waterproofing, and conservation partnerships. This initiative addresses Columbia's lag in sustainability transparency compared to competitors like Patagonia and North Face, while leveraging the brand's NASA collaboration to build credibility. The campaign aims to strengthen Columbia's position as a leader in sustainable outdoor performance.

## Actionability

- Develop a campaign narrative centered on Omni-Tech's circular lifecycle and NASA validation
- Create a series of videos and social media content showcasing sustainability efforts
- Partner with influencers and conservation organizations to amplify the message
- Launch the campaign ahead of Earth Day 2026 to maximize impact
