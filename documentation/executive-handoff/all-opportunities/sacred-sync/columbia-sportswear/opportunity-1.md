# Omni-Tech Outdoor Subscription Box

## Description

Introduce a subscription service where customers receive curated outdoor gear packages based on seasonal needs and activity preferences. Each box would feature Columbia's proprietary technologies like Omni-Heat and Omni-Shield, along with personalized recommendations for upcoming adventures. This service would cater to casual outdoor enthusiasts who seek performance gear without the upfront investment. The subscription model aligns with Columbia's value positioning and operational efficiency goals, while also driving recurring revenue and enhancing customer loyalty.

## Actionability

- Conduct customer research with casual outdoor enthusiasts to validate interest in a subscription model
- Partner with logistics providers to develop a scalable fulfillment process
- Prototype a seasonal box featuring Omni-Tech products and adventure guides
- Launch a pilot program in key markets (e.g., U.S. and China) to test demand
