# AR-Powered Omni-Tech Showroom

## Description

Develop an augmented reality (AR) showroom experience that allows customers to virtually test Columbia's Omni-Tech products in simulated outdoor environments. This digital experience would bridge the gap between online and in-store shopping, enabling users to see how gear performs in extreme conditions like rain, snow, or heat. The AR showroom aligns with Columbia's 'Engineered for Whatever' platform and addresses the brand's lag in digital experience innovation. By enhancing the digital touchpoint, Columbia can boost DTC sales and reduce returns through virtual try-on.

## Actionability

- Conduct a feasibility study with AR technology providers to identify the best platform
- Prototype an AR experience showcasing Omni-Heat and Omni-Shield in simulated weather conditions
- Integrate the AR showroom into Columbia's website and mobile app
- Launch a marketing campaign highlighting the AR feature ahead of the holiday shopping season

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we extend this AR experience to include multi-brand products?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the success of the AR showroom?
3. How can we ensure this experience is accessible to customers in emerging markets?
