# Omni-Tech Performance Home Essentials

## Description

Expand Columbia's proprietary technologies into a line of home products designed for outdoor enthusiasts, creating a seamless indoor-outdoor performance ecosystem. The 'Omni-Home' collection would include items like thermal window films using Omni-Heat, Omni-Shield outdoor furniture covers, and prAna-inspired yoga space organizers. This product line leverages Columbia's NASA-validated technologies beyond apparel, targeting core users' desire for performance in all aspects of life. The initiative aligns with Columbia's portfolio diversification priority and reduces seasonality impact.

- Develop a marketing strategy to bundle Omni-Home products with Columbia apparel
- Launch the collection through Columbia's DTC channels and select wholesale partners
