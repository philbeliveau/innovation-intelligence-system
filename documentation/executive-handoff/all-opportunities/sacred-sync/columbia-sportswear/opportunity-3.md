# Columbia x Local Artisans Limited Collection

## Description

Collaborate with local artisans in key markets like India and China to co-create limited-edition outdoor gear collections that blend Columbia's performance technologies with traditional craftsmanship. This initiative would support Columbia's strategic priority of localized market expansion while differentiating the brand from competitors with a unique cultural storytelling angle. The collections would feature Columbia's proprietary technologies like Omni-Heat and Omni-Shield, combined with region-specific designs and materials. This partnership enhances Columbia's authenticity and relevance in growing markets.

- Identify and partner with local artisans in India and China for initial collaborations
- Develop a pilot collection featuring Himalayan-inspired designs using Omni-Tech
- Launch the collection through Chogori India Retail and China Hike Party events
- Create a marketing campaign highlighting the cultural storytelling behind the designs
