# Seasonal Cheese and Yogurt Lines

## Description

Introduce seasonal cheese and yogurt lines under the Cracker Barrel and Astro brands, tied to Canadian seasons and holidays. These products would create anticipation and renewal among consumers, reinforcing Lactalis Canada’s local relevance. Examples include winter spiced cheddar and summer berry yogurt, promoted through limited-time campaigns that celebrate Canadian moments and traditions.

## Actionability

- Conduct a survey to identify the most popular seasonal flavors among Canadian consumers.
- Develop prototypes of seasonal cheese and yogurt products using Lactalis Canada’s existing facilities.
- Create a marketing plan for a limited-time seasonal campaign tied to Canadian holidays.
- Launch the seasonal products in select Canadian markets and monitor sales performance.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we extend the seasonal product line to include lactose-free or plant-based options?
2. What would be the ideal timing for launching each seasonal product to maximize sales?
3. Which Canadian retailers could we partner with to enhance the visibility of these seasonal products?
