# Canadian Fusion Plant-Based Cheese

## Description

Develop a 'Canadian Fusion' plant-based cheese line under the Enjoy brand, inspired by Canadian flavors like maple and wild berries. This product would appeal to flexitarian consumers seeking innovative, culturally resonant plant-based options. The Canadian Fusion line would bridge traditional and modern diets, leveraging Lactalis Canada’s dairy infrastructure and Canadian heritage to stand out in the competitive plant-based market.

## Actionability

- Conduct focus groups with flexitarian consumers to validate interest in Canadian-inspired plant-based cheeses.
- Partner with a flavor development company to create unique recipes incorporating maple and wild berry flavors.
- Develop a prototype of a maple-infused plant-based cheese using Lactalis Canada’s plant-based production facilities.
- Create a marketing plan that highlights the Canadian heritage and innovative nature of the product line.

## Follow-up Prompts

1. How might we adapt this product line for other Canadian flavors, such as smoked salmon or poutine?
2. What would be the best distribution channels to reach flexitarian consumers?
3. Which Canadian food festivals or events could we leverage to promote this product line?
