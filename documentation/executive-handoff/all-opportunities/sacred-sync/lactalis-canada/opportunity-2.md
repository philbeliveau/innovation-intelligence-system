# Dairy Footprint App

## Description

Develop a 'Dairy Footprint' app that allows consumers to track the environmental impact of their Lactalis Canada purchases, such as carbon emissions saved and packaging recycled. The app would also provide tips for sustainable dairy consumption, helping eco-conscious consumers make more informed choices. This digital tool would position Lactalis Canada as a sustainability leader in the dairy industry and deepen engagement with health-conscious families and organic-focused parents.

## Actionability

- Partner with a sustainability tech firm to develop the app’s carbon tracking capabilities.
- Create a beta version of the app and test it with a focus group of eco-conscious consumers.
- Integrate the app with Lactalis Canada’s e-commerce platform to allow for seamless purchase tracking.
- Launch a marketing campaign to promote the app as part of Lactalis Canada’s commitment to sustainability.
