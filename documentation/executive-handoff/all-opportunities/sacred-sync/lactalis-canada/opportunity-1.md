# Functional Heritage Cheese Line

## Description

Lactalis Canada can create a new line of functional heritage cheeses under the Cracker Barrel brand, combining traditional craftsmanship with modern health benefits like probiotics and adaptogens. This line would appeal to health-conscious families and flexitarian consumers seeking functional nutrition. The products would be marketed with storytelling that highlights Lactalis Canada’s 140-year heritage and its commitment to modern health trends, reinforcing the brand’s position as a leader in both traditional and emerging dairy categories.

## Actionability

- Conduct customer research with health-conscious families and flexitarian consumers to validate interest in functional cheeses.
- Partner with a nutrition research firm to identify the most effective functional ingredients (e.g., probiotics, adaptogens).
- Develop a prototype of a probiotic-infused cheddar cheese using Lactalis Canada’s existing cheese-making facilities.
- Create a marketing plan that includes storytelling around Lactalis Canada’s heritage and the health benefits of the new product line.
