# Canadian Dairy Stories Campaign

## Description

Launch a 'Canadian Dairy Stories' campaign that highlights Lactalis Canada’s role in Canadian dairy farming and community initiatives through videos and social media content. The campaign would feature Canadian dairy farmers, Lactalis Canada’s ESG initiatives, and the brand’s 140-year history, creating an emotional connection with consumers. Partnering with local influencers would amplify the reach and reinforce Lactalis Canada’s positioning as Canada’s premier dairy company.

## Actionability

- Conduct interviews with Canadian dairy farmers to gather authentic stories for the campaign.
- Partner with a creative agency to produce high-quality videos and social media content.
- Identify and collaborate with local influencers to amplify the campaign’s reach.
- Launch the campaign across social media platforms and Lactalis Canada’s website.
