# AI-Driven Global Fusion Spice Blends

## Description

Develop a new line of AI-powered spice blends that combine traditional flavors from different cuisines, creating unique and adventurous combinations. For example, a 'Peruvian Aji Amarillo + Thai Lemongrass Fusion' blend. McCormick’s partnership with IBM Research positions it to lead in computational flavor development, appealing to Millennials and Gen Z who crave authentic yet innovative flavors. This initiative aligns with McCormick’s 'more and faster' innovation strategy and its goal to capture the growing global flavor market.

## Actionability

- Conduct consumer research to identify top flavor combinations for fusion blends.
- Collaborate with IBM Research to use AI for developing and testing initial blend recipes.
- Prototype three fusion blends and test them in focus groups.
- Develop packaging design that highlights the cultural fusion aspect of the blends.
- Plan a launch campaign with social media influencers to drive trial among younger consumers.
