# Co-Branded Viral Trend Products

## Description

Collaborate with popular restaurants to co-create retail products that bring viral food trends into consumers’ homes. For example, a 'Dave’s Hot Chicken x Frank’s RedHot Nashville Hot Seasoning' or a 'Cholula Birria Ramen Kit.' These co-branded products will bridge the gap between restaurants and retail, appealing to ethnic cuisine enthusiasts and convenience seekers. This initiative leverages McCormick’s Flavor Solutions segment and its ability to capitalize on viral food trends, driving brand buzz and sales.

## Actionability

- Identify trending restaurants and initiate partnership discussions.
- Develop product prototypes in collaboration with restaurant chefs.
- Test the products in focus groups to refine flavors and packaging.
- Plan a launch campaign with social media influencers and in-store demos.
- Monitor sales and consumer feedback to assess the success of the co-branded products.
