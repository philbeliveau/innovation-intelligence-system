# Cultural Authenticity Campaign

## Description

Launch a marketing campaign highlighting culturally authentic product lines, such as yoga mats inspired by Indian traditions or cycling gear reflecting urban mobility trends in China. This campaign strengthens Decathlon’s brand affinity in key growth markets by resonating with local cultural values and sustainability-minded consumers. It leverages Decathlon’s global presence and vertical integration for localized innovation.

## Actionability

- Develop a Van Rysel cycling line tailored to Chinese urban commuting trends.
- Create culturally relevant marketing campaigns for India and China.
- Promote through social media and in-store activations.
- Measure campaign impact through sales and customer feedback.
