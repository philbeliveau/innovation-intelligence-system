**Project:** Innovation Intelligence System
**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Proof of Concept Complete - Ready for Productionization Review

---

## What We Created

We built and tested a **5-stage AI-powered pipeline** that automatically transforms market signals into brand-specific innovation opportunities. The system processes diverse inputs—trend reports, market research, competitor moves, technology signals—and generates actionable opportunity cards tailored to each brand's strategic context.

### Proof of Concept Results

**Scale:**
- **110 opportunities generated** across 24 test scenarios
- **6 diverse market signals** processed (Thai beverage trends, UK premium fast food, Danish fashion resale, sports entertainment, wellness trends, marketing campaigns)
- **4 test brands** from different industries (McCormick USA, Lactalis Canada, Columbia Sportswear, Decathlon)

**Performance:**
- **91.7% success rate** (22/24 scenarios completed successfully)
- **143 seconds average** per opportunity generation (2.4 minutes)
- **Zero manual intervention** required during batch execution
- **57 minutes total** to generate all 110 opportunities

### How It Works

The pipeline automatically:
1. **Analyzes market signals** to extract core insights
2. **Identifies emerging trends** across behavioral, cultural, technological, and economic dimensions
3. **Translates patterns** into cross-industry inspirations
4. **Contextualizes to brand** using strategic priorities and capabilities
5. **Generates detailed opportunity cards** with actionable next steps
