# R&D Funding Summary - Innovation Intelligence System

## Overt Benefit

Deliver 20x more high-quality innovation opportunities in Stage 1 of the Stage-Gate pipeline, transforming how CPG innovation teams discover and validate breakthrough innovations.

## The Innovation Pipeline

**INSPIRATIONS** → [R&D Pipeline] → **HIGH-POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES** → [R&D Framework] → **VALIDATED OPPORTUNITIES**

## Critical R&D Development Areas

### R&D Area 1: Intelligence Pipeline (Inspirations → High-Potential)
**Objective:** Create a pipeline 10x better than manual processes at generating high-potential opportunities.

**Research Evidence:** Wharton researchers (Meincke et al., 2024) found LLMs generate product ideas with higher purchase intent than MBA students with 40x efficiency (200 ideas in 15 minutes vs. 5). Stanford study (2024) found LLM ideas significantly more novel (p < 0.05), but weaker on feasibility.

**R&D Focus:**
- **Multi-source intelligence ingestion:** Research optimal methods for processing patents, research papers, startup activity, market signals, and social trends
- **Advanced embedding techniques:** Develop semantic similarity analysis to identify cross-domain patterns and reduce idea redundancy
- **Multi-agent collaboration:** Test whether specialized AI agents (pattern recognition, market psychology, biomimicry, TRIZ) working together can maintain LLM novelty advantages while fixing feasibility deficits
- **Quality filtering:** Build ML models that predict which generated ideas have highest potential for Stage-Gate success

**Reasons to Believe (RTB):**
1. Cross-domain pattern recognition (TRIZ, biomimicry) finds solutions humans miss
2. Continuous monitoring vs. periodic manual research catches emerging signals earlier
3. AI processes 40x more raw inputs, increasing probability of breakthrough discoveries
4. Multi-agent validation reduces LLM feasibility weakness identified in research

### R&D Area 2: Validation Framework (High-Potential → Validated)
**Objective:** Accelerate transformation of high-potential opportunities into validated, implementable innovations.

**R&D Focus:**
- **Multidimensional assessment:** Develop and test validation methodologies (SPECTRE framework: Structural, Psychological, Economic, Cultural, Technical, Risk, Execution) plus ML-based feasibility scoring
- **Psychological appropriation:** Research conversational AI techniques that help teams internalize external ideas through structured elicitation (transforming "AI idea" into "our idea")
- **Progressive validation workflow:** Build systematic framework that guides teams from initial concept through evidence-based validation stages
- **Learning system:** Capture annotations of successful/failed validations to continuously improve assessment accuracy

**Reasons to Believe (RTB):**
1. Structured frameworks prevent ad-hoc evaluation bias that kills good ideas
2. AI-facilitated elicitation builds internal conviction faster than traditional processes
3. Systematic validation catches fatal flaws early, reducing wasted Stage-Gate investment
4. Progressive framework maintains momentum vs. manual back-and-forth delays

## Target & Status

**Target:** Innovation teams at large CPG companies (P&G, Unilever, etc.)

**Status:** Early validation phase. No proprietary datasets, trained systems, or production implementations exist. All architecture and frameworks are conceptual.
