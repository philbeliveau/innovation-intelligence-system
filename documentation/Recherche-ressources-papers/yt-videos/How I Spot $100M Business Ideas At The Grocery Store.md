So, we have with us today the king of commerce, the titan of Target, the big
0:06
man of the brand, Eric Ryan is here.
0:15
You are the co-founder, the inventor of products that sit on a lot of people's shelves. There's some in my kitchen
0:22
right now. Method soap was one one of the big ones. Uh Olly Gummies that my
0:27
kids have every day. uh Wellie Band-Aids and then you're investor and a whole bunch more. So you are here and you're
0:33
kind of uh the magic man when it comes to reinventing consumer categories. So
0:39
when we did our call before this, we agreed to do two things. I said, I want to know your playbook. How do you do
0:45
this? How do you go into the category and figure out which product to select and how to disrupt it? And you have this
0:50
like four-step process or whatever you outlined to me. And the other thing is we agreed that we would each bring a
0:56
couple of ideas of kind of halfbaked ideas of brands that we think an entrepreneur could go do and we're going
1:02
to kind of pitch them back and forth to each other. We didn't tell each other beforehand and so we'll see what what we came up with. How's that sound?
1:08
Amazing. That sounds great. And that is way too kind of an introduction. So thrilled to be here and I way too kind.
1:14
Thank you. H h how big were some of these businesses just so we understand the uh the magnitude here?
1:21
They are they're both probably getting close to billion dollar brands now. But when you go in and see like even 10
1:28
million of soap or vitamins sitting in a warehouse, that's what always blows me away of like how many units we actually
1:35
these products and that are sitting in people's homes today. And I've been looking forward to this cuz I remember Sam used to host this
1:41
conference called HustleCon and he would invite founders, entrepreneurs come speak. I didn't know your story at all.
1:46
I was sitting there in the crowd and I remember you got on stage and you talked about how you started Method, how you
1:53
started Olly, how you started Wellie and you had all these little phrases. You were like, I walk through the aisles and
1:59
I look for and I saw just a sea of sameness and you had a picture of the soap aisle or the dish soap aisle and it
2:04
was like every single one was green and looked like, you know, green packaging
2:09
and looked just like a old school like my mom's cleaning product. And then you had this like totally different shape of
2:16
a bottle. It was like, you know, blue or purple or whatever. And it was and and it stood out. And I remember the way you
2:21
talked about it. I really had never thought about how much thought goes into
2:26
which category to go into, how do you actually bring something fresh and new to the table, and then how do you hustle
2:32
to get it off the ground? You had a great talk that day. And so I know that was like whatever a decade ago, but if
2:37
we can get even close to that, this will be a success uh from my perspective. And you said it in passing just now, but
2:44
Method is, you know, probably a billion dollar brand. Now Ali Gummies is also um
2:50
the Ali the vitamin company is is also probably half a billion to to a billion dollar brand. And so that's pretty
2:56
amazing. And I I think like one of the other claims fame is Target loves you, don't they? I feel like somebody told me
3:03
this, they go Target loves that guy. I love Target. So it's a m it's a mutual
3:08
love affair. You've like launched brands with them like even from the start, right? You have like a kind of a unique relationship with them. Is that right?
3:15
I do. I mean, what we did back in oh god 2002 when we pitched this idea of designer commodities like no and it was
3:21
at a time where no mass retailer worked with startups and so uh through a lot of hailmary passes and some some good luck
3:27
we were able to be the first to kind of go in there and it's just it's been an amazing partnership ever since.
Look for a sea of sameness
3:33
So can we do your your process before we brainstorm the ideas? I want to hear the the process you outlined. And I took a
3:39
couple notes so I can kind of prompt you. But you basically had told me these four three or four things that you do
3:44
when you go go in because I was like, you've done this not once, not twice, but three times. And I was like, can I
3:49
nerd out with you a little bit? Yeah. And as you're going to hear, I'm really annoying to go to a grocery store with. Um to me, it's like the Super Bowl
3:55
of commerce. So every time I'm in a mass retailer, a grocery store or drugstore, I'm always hunting. So I came out of uh
4:02
I have a really simple model and it was built off of this idea of what I learned in advertising which is how do you take
4:08
a really deep consumer insight and translate to great creative execution. So my kind of core thesis as an
4:14
entrepreneur is to look for these you know like you said these kind of white spaces where um there's a sea of
4:21
sameness and it just kind of smells ripe to go in and do different. And what I do is I look for a cultural shift or a big
4:28
macro trend that that that category has missed. And then in between that and
4:34
where the category is is the business opportunity. So in the case of method there was like two big culture shifts I
4:39
found. Um one was this idea of lifestyling of the home. You know this is back in 2002. You you know you look
4:45
at a dish soap more than you use it. But nobody thought about these products as part of like the emotional connection to
4:50
your home and you know making decorative basically looking good on your sink. So
4:55
like I keep my method soap next to my my faucet. So just like looking good when it's on my counter.
5:01
Exactly. Which is because you look at it more than you actually use it. So it's it's a pretty meaningful part of the experience of buying a dish soap.
5:07
At that time did you see what what else did you see where you're like, "Huh, that's new. That's new." But and then you you applied that to dish soap. So
5:13
what what else were people doing that you where you noticed the shift before you did it
5:18
was really in personal care and so a lot of like like I'm I always say like I'm a bit of a thief too like I don't steal
5:24
from our competition but I try to steal from as far away as possible. So in method there's two areas I stole. I
5:30
stole from personal care. So if you looked at the colors the fragrances compared to like how home care which was these like really toxic um cleaners at
5:38
the time. So, I brought a lot of that personal care approach over to home care. And I also stole from the
5:44
housewares. I would always say like I go to a department store, I'd look at the beauty aisle and then I would look at the housewares aisle up top. And so, we
5:51
stole like all these beautiful vase shapes. And so, we wanted these things to look like little objects of desire,
5:57
you know, sitting on your countertop. Okay. So, first thing you said was you
6:02
look for a cultural shift that's happening that a category has missed. So, it's happening and it's maybe
6:08
happening elsewhere cuz what do they say about the the future? The future is here. It's just not evenly distributed.
6:13
So, you know, the shift is starting to happen, but maybe it hasn't hit in in the home care aisle yet or hasn't hit
6:19
Oh my god, I guess steal that from you. That's great. That's not an original. That's a bunch of VCs like to say that
6:26
one. All right. So, so that's the first thing you do. And are you looking for a new
6:32
category or you looking for a pre-existing big category? What What do you like to do? So, like some people
6:37
would say, "Oh, that's already done. It's already saturated. I need to go find something that doesn't exist yet."
6:42
And they're making bets on what doesn't exist. And seems like what you did was you went into things that already existed and you weren't scared of the
6:50
saturation or that it's already been done for 50 years. No, that's right. I I think it's much
6:55
easier to make money by creating an iteration off of something already exists because then you don't have to drive all the consumer education to
7:01
educate and explain something that's wildly new. And I was living in the uh in London in the 90s. I was super
7:07
inspired by Richard Branson as as many entrepreneurs are. But what I liked about he he had a model and I think
7:13
that's what inspired me to create a model. His model is an entertainment model, right? So he'd go in these really unsexy industries like airlines and he'd
7:19
apply his entertainment model um that he really understood well. And so I was
7:25
always inspired by this idea and I looked at that, you know, if you looked at any successful serial entrepreneur,
7:30
they typically had a model. But what I also loved about Richard did is he went into like really wellestablished
7:35
categories that were easy to understand and just put his twist on it. And so that very much became a lot of the way I
7:41
thought about um how I would approach entrepreneurship. And then you talked about being a thief.
7:47
Can you can you give a couple examples there? So you said I go to a big category. I walk through the aisles. I look for the sea of sameness. I look for
7:54
a culture shift. Oh, sorry. You told me one other thing that was great. Uh you go you said something. You go, have they
8:00
made it unnecessarily over over complicated? And you go, I think they're hiding something. There's an insecurity
8:06
there if they've made this product category feel over complicated and that they take themsel and and another one
8:12
was taking themselves too seriously. Can you talk about those two attributes also? Yeah. So, I think anytime a category is
8:19
taking themselves too serious, as you said, they're they're probably hiding something, right? There's like an insecurity there. And so a lot of my
8:25
model too is going into these categories that are unnecessary, complicated. Can I really simplify it back, make it easy
8:31
for the consumer? And also, I love categories that take themselves way too serious. And so I love to bring almost
8:38
like an inner child approach into the categories that are great. So if you look at method, it's it's kind of like
8:43
what a kid would use to clean the kitchen. If you looked at Ali, like I got adults to take gummy vitamins, uh,
8:49
you know, in masses. That didn't happen before. with Wellie, I got adults to wear, you know, bandages with patterns
8:56
and colors on it versus just the the nude ones that are supposed to hide away with your skin, but never really do. And
9:02
um you know what I I tried to do with that the idea of a culture shift. So if you look if you look at method, it was
9:09
both this idea of lifestyle of the home, but also at the time, you know, you were asked to pollute when you clean or use
9:14
poison to make your home healthier. So there was this other big macro trend of health and wellness and sustainability, but to your point, you know, it was
9:21
showing up some categories, but it was yet to show up here. So it's really connecting the dots on those trends and
9:26
bringing it to new spaces that I I find is is kind of core to my model.
Trend trips
9:31
I saw that you um you said that one of your favorite ways to come up with ideas is to travel abroad. We had this guy
9:38
named Kevin Ryan on the podcast. Kevin has founded this thing called MongoDB, which is like a $30 billion software
9:43
business. But very interestingly he he also started guilt which is you know guilt group the the women's clothing
9:49
thing and he was like I got the idea for guilt when I went to France and I think I saw this thing called the vendi I
9:55
think I think it was called where it was um basically like flash sales for clothing and so he would heal talked
10:00
about that as well of going abroad. When you go abroad and you like to travel do you like are you are you going on trips
10:06
just to find ideas? Yeah totally. It's a I I think by far
10:12
for me it's where I get my best ideas for a couple reasons. One, I just think better when I'm in motion. So, you know,
10:19
walking retail um with a cup of coffee in your hand, there's ideas flow better than ever sitting at a desk. Two is we
10:26
do these like trend trips where we also take designers with us. And so our goal is not only to spot ideas, but translate
10:32
it immediately into a design idea that we can bring back, but also when you're you're in a you know a foreign country,
10:39
um you're jet-lagged, which means nobody's bothering you. Um I think you see when you're when you're jetlagged
10:45
too, you look at things a little bit more fuzzier, which could be a good good thing, but also just opens up new pathways when you're you're walking
10:51
retail where everything is foreign, you don't understand the language. And for me, like trying to connect the dots
10:57
between seeing what somebody's doing in one category, could we apply that to another space um is so much easier to do
11:03
when you're out of your home market. So what's an example? So where would you go and what's an example of maybe an
11:09
idea you had while you were on one of these trend trips that turned into like a success with one of your brands?
11:16
Yeah, I mean some of I think one of my most favorite was and this was like 20 years ago. This was before
11:21
collaborations became such, you know, a mainstream part of building any brand. But we got Orla Kylie who is really
11:28
known for very expensive handbags and patterns to do a collaboration with us at Target, which as far as I know is the
11:33
first ever designer collaboration and somebody who is known for very expensive items, being able to bring those
11:39
patterns into a product that sold for $3 and was the first time I think Target ever did a designer collaboration like
11:45
at that price point. So that was out of London was a was a huge success. Uh there was a building we saw in Japan
11:51
that we absolutely love the way it was skinned. We turned that into a handwash design.
11:56
Like the shape of the building or what do you mean? Yeah, it was like the texture of the building had this uh it was in Tokyo and
12:02
just had this incredible kind of like pillowed um texture on the outside of it and we turned that as inspiration into a
12:09
bottle. And you're saying that like really simply like, oh, we we saw the texture of a building in Tokyo and then
12:15
it turned it into a handwash of like that doesn't even those dots seem really far apart. Can you describe your actual
12:22
process? So you you go to Japan presumably, right? You're then going to do what? You just
12:30
whiskey. He said the texture of the building. That's like when you when you're like on drugs, you're like,
12:36
can you feel this building? Wouldn't it be great if that was a bottle of soap? Okay, so I try to design everything like
12:44
an object because it's all about creating these like little objects of desire, especially when you're doing it
12:49
in a category like soap that you have to buy and you're trying to turn into something you want to buy. So I look at
12:54
everything kind of through this idea of it's an object. So I looked at a building, the building looks like an object. And it was easy for me to think
13:00
about like, oh my god, that pattern, that shape, that texture is amazing. What if that little object was sitting
13:06
on a shelf at a store versus in the ground as a building? So, it's like
13:12
trying to look for those types of patterns or um the original method bottle was this camping fuel bottle I
13:19
found in Norway. And I just love the shoulders on that that that bottle. So, we translated that into our first our
13:25
first ever product cuz we couldn't afford a duster designer at that point. So, I had to find something we could just uh riff off of.
13:33
Hey everyone, really quick. I can already tell that this is an episode that you guys are going to be taking a lot of notes on. And that's kind of a
13:39
pain in the butt to do while you're either watching or listening to this. And so we actually made it really easy. We made the entire episode uh and into a
13:47
downloadable PDF. So you could actually download the transcript, look at the notes, and this way you could just sit
13:52
back and enjoy the podcast right now and get the notes later. So the link is in the description below. Click it if you
13:58
want those notes. Now back to the episode. You told me something that I loved. You
14:03
said my favorite question when I'm doing these trips is what if this but for that
14:10
and you said something. You go, you know, I'm trying to take one dot over here and then say what if that was
14:15
connected to this dot over here and you said something cool. You go the further apart those two things are, the more
14:22
powerful the potential idea. Like it's not always going to work, but like if you just look at your competitors and
14:27
you say, "Oh, we could do that too." That that's not a very powerful idea. But if you take something from a whole different country or industry or like
14:34
different genre and you bring it to your genre, all of a sudden you have something, right? By the way, an example
14:40
that just came to mind, I got little kids and the most popular show right now on Netflix is K-pop Demon Hunters. And
14:46
they basically did like K-pop music, but then like kids cartoon, American kids
14:52
cartoons, which like wasn't what people were doing before. Like you were doing Coco Melons, like a baby singing American nursery rhymes. And right now
14:59
the most popular songs for like you know five to eight year olds half the lyrics are in Korean but they love it and it
15:05
worked and they you know they connected two different dots that seemed far apart but it created a pretty powerful idea
15:10
when it works. Yeah. And first of all you make me really miss being able to watch cartoons with my kids cuz they're all older now.
15:17
I love that show and it I think what you're describing is really it's about creating creative tension and the more
15:23
two disparate ideas are that come together the more creative tension. So method was really the first to do
Remix opposing ideas
15:29
ecochic. So we brought together high design and deep sustainability. Those were really two opposing ideas but by
15:35
bringing it together it created this this creative tension and also when you have creative tension you create a
15:40
deeper experience that also drives much more loyalty and people stay um within the brand. So that that's exactly right.
15:47
So I try to look for the most two disparate ideas that could come together. The other part that that unpacks is this idea of of of finding
15:53
something that lives at that intersection of familiar and novel. So if it's too familiar, right, it lacks
15:59
complete differentiation. If it's too novel, it's incredibly foreign and it becomes harder to get somebody to try
16:05
it. So I look for those those ideas that bring together exactly what you just said of this creative tension, but
16:10
there's enough familiarity in it. You can jump into it, but there's enough novelty to it that it makes it a new
16:16
experience. Um, and there, you know, it's easy to say, but it's hard to find. That's the art form, I think, of finding
16:21
those intersections. I'm not sure what percentage of Wellie or um, Method Soap you would say was to
16:29
just the fact that it was a different colored band-aid or a different shaped bottle, but if it's a high percentage,
16:35
it's sort of insane. That's sort of that's kind of a that's kind of a hard you're like this. It's almost like this
16:41
seems too easy a little bit, right? The more I try to innovate, the less
16:46
successful I've been where I've moved more into that space of being too novel.
16:52
I think I fail more times by being too novel than being too familiar. Like I we launched the most amazing laundry
16:58
detergent years ago. It was 10x concentrated. So, it was the size of a shampoo bottle
17:04
for 50 loads of laundry, but because it was so small, this was an idea I got out of Japan, too, where I saw they had
17:09
bigger laundry detergent, but they would use these almost like the Axe uh mouthwash where you squeeze it,
17:15
pre-measures it. But we turned it into where you just pump it, a pre-measured dose. But it was so hard to get
17:21
consumers to believe that something so small could be so effective because they've been trained forever that, you
17:27
know, a giant jug of laundry detergent is what you need to get your your clothes clean. But yeah, I've I've always usually overinnovated when I
17:34
failed than underinoated. It's I I think I saw a quote with you and Simon Synynic uh with with his on
17:40
his podcast. You said, "If it's hard, it's probably wrong." And then he said, "I know I have a good idea when I can't
17:45
believe others aren't doing it." And I think that when a lot of entrepreneurs want to grow their companies or start a
17:51
new company, I know I fall victim to this all the time. I somehow think that there's a correlation between, this
17:58
sounds controversial, but there's a correlation between how hard I work or how hard something is and how much value
18:03
a customer will get and or how valuable my business can get. Yeah. There's a kind of this golden rule and this came out of a lot of parallel
18:09
and fashion, which is if you change one thing, like if you do, you know, one iteration off of the the core, you have
18:16
a higher probability of success. The second you change two or three things, um, you're most likely going to fail.
18:22
It's almost like an advertising. We used to say if you throw a consumer an egg, they're going to catch it. If you throw
18:27
them two or three eggs, their chances are they're going to drop it because you're throwing too much change at them too fast. Whether that's communication
18:34
or a product. But I also I think it's such a it's we live in such a surplus world, right, of
18:40
like endless ideas and choices that I think it creates this pressure to really
18:45
sometimes overnovate to be too different. And to your point of like if it seems so obvious then I would always
18:52
get tripped up of like well why has nobody done this before if it's this obvious to me.
18:57
That's a really good insight. That's a really good insight about the to you know just change one thing. Do you think
19:02
that that applies across software companies or internet companies or is that just commerce or or fashion like
19:08
things that are um more consumable and that I touch and feel and wear? I think it applies to everything whether you're
19:14
launching I mean even if you're you know within a B2B business arguably you're just as distracted as a consumer as you
19:22
are when you're you know I think I guess a real consumer and I don't know that world as well but I would imagine again
19:31
just creating simple iterations off of a successful model is way more likely to to succeed than trying to create
19:38
something radically new from scratch or when something radically new from scratch has started I mean, think about like in the social space of, you know,
19:44
MySpace, Brenner, it was really the third that got it right, but it's just kind of simple iterations off of that
19:50
first model. I did a call the other day with um an AI company that's raised a
19:55
ton of money and they have this huge valuation bas close basically a billion dollar valuation and they initially grew
20:02
because in AI AI is so hot, there's so much attention that people were willing
20:08
to try a bunch of things, but now they're like, hey, how do we grow from here? So they were like, "Hey, really respect your uh growth ideas. We want to
20:14
do a growth session." I was like, "I don't know, guys. It's not really my, you know, like I don't know if I can solve your problem, but cool. I'll jump
20:19
on a call." And we get on the call and they start telling me all about this all the stuff. And I just kept asking the
20:26
same question and I was like, "Cool. So why would somebody choose to use you? Like why?" Cuz most people today are
20:31
using tool A. You want them to switch to tool B. And I was like, "Awesome. So like why is
20:36
tool B better than tool A?" And then they were like, "Oh, it's way better." like in all these other all these
20:41
different ways. I was like, "Awesome. So, just like tell me the one that like is the biggest one that would immediately convince me." And they were
20:48
like, "Well, well, there's not really like one." And I was like, "Cool. Okay, so let's say there's three. Just tell me one of them
20:55
first." They were so focused on we're better that they forgot to say we're different. Like, how are you better in a
21:00
sing and like they were trying to throw four eggs and I was like, none of those eggs were very convincing and they all
21:06
just cracked on me, right? And I wish they had just thrown me one egg. They said, "Listen, for this type of person,
21:11
here's the problem with the tools that you're currently using and we can we do it this way instead." And I say I, you
21:16
know, that that would resonate. That would be obviously the ideal scenario. So I definitely think this applies to not just consumer products.
21:22
Do you know where I think that comes from is just pure ego. I think a lot of entrepreneurs like their ego gets in the
21:28
way and so they want they almost intentionally over complicate it to show how special the product is, therefore
21:33
how special they are. And the best entrepreneurs I've always met are the ones who take incredibly complex ideas
21:39
and simplify it down. And it then it's easy for consumers to get it, for their teams to execute. And I think that that
21:46
that art form of simplification is the the biggest hack in entrepreneurship.
21:51
And yeah, the number of pitches I sit through and like I'm like you're intentionally over complicating this to
21:57
to justify evaluation or justify your specialness. I I think it is ego, but there is
22:02
something strange. I think that like it's easy for you to think this because you've done it so many times, but there
22:07
is something strange where it's like, wait, so if I just change the color of the band-aids, it's going to win. And
22:13
that's obviously you've done you've done a lot more than that. But like within my company, I run a within within within my
22:19
company with my employees, they'll be like, "We have to do this, this, this, or this." I'm like, "But what if we just
22:24
like don't do any of that and just make better ads or you know, like you just like just do one thing." But for some reason that's hard to conceptualize that
22:31
like just a minor change on one thing can create a significant amount of value because you think to yourself I have to
22:37
work $1 billion worth of work or put $1 billion worth of effort in order to have a $1 billion idea but it's often times
22:44
it's it's that's not the reality. Well, can we do an example here with uh you talked a little about method. I want
Case Study: Olly
22:50
to talk about Ali. Uh maybe it's cuz I take it every day, maybe my kids take it. So it's like very like in my life
22:55
and um you went into the vitamins category. So, let's imagine let's take you back. I don't know what year this was. You walked into the vitamins
23:01
category. You're looking there and you see um you know a a bunch of sort of nature type of looking things. You got
23:08
maybe Flintstone vitamins just still hanging on for dear life. And you saw an opportunity. I just want to give you one
23:14
prompt which is he said something on the pre-call that was hilarious. Sam, he goes, "I went into the aisle and I saw Okay, cool. Um you know, first thing I
23:20
observed all of them around. So, I thought, okay, I guess we're going to have a square packaging." And I just thought that's literally the funniest
23:26
like the funniest way of like well I guess that's that then everybody's round so we must be square. If everybody was
23:32
square then we would have been round. Like it's as simple as that. And there was no focus groups. There was no it was like yeah like they're all
23:37
they're all round so we had no choice but to be square. That's awesome. And the other thing I remember was
23:44
vitamins used to be like a a game of inference. So you would it would say you know whatever uh vitamin D but you don't
23:51
know what vitamin D does, right? you'd have to then know what is the purpose of vitamin D or what is the purpose of melatonin or what is the purpose of I
23:57
don't know whatever the thing that puts you to sleep but you guys just wrote sleep and you wrote like you know
24:02
immunity right like you just wrote the benefit instead of the the feature and I was like oh that was also quite simple
24:09
of a of a change to make uh can you talk about take us back you go you walk into that aisle or I don't know how it
24:14
actually started but yeah so I we had I sold method um but I
24:19
still involved and I I first of all like I For the first time in my life, I'm I'm pretty optimistic, happy by default
24:26
person. But for the first time in my life, I felt a little royalist because I was like, I'm an entrepreneur. And suddenly I was did not feel like an
24:31
entrepreneur anymore. I was working for somebody else. And I was also doing a project for for Target to create what we
24:38
called made to matter. And the and the goal was to get them to have credit for having all these natural brands. And so
24:45
we were looking for these uh brands that connected with millennial moms. And we couldn't find any. we couldn't find one
24:51
for the vitamin category. So, I just went and literally walked the aisle and first thing I noticed was people stressing out trying to choose something
24:57
that was healthy for them. Since I think I was studying the aisle, people assumed maybe I knew what I was doing. And so, like people would just randomly ask me
25:04
like, "Do you know what magnesium's for?" Um, you work there. It was Yeah, they were just like
25:10
standing here staring at us. Just lost people in that aisle. And it was a dog's breakfast. It was really
25:17
hard to shop. The brands were super uninspiring. packaging was terrible. So that was the clue dig here. And so the
25:23
first thing I tried to figure out was like, all right, what is, you know, kind of going back, what is that big cultural shift this category is missing. And what
25:29
I figured it out was um it was really millennials view health and wellness as a lifestyle pursuit. And what the clue
25:36
for me and kind of what you said earlier of like you start seeing these trends in one area, the the clue was really soul
25:42
cycle and the way that SoulCycle had been had repositioned
25:47
um fitness into something that was almost spiritual. But I love the branding of SoulCycle, the name, the
25:54
whole identity. And so my inspiration a little was like all right, what would the Soul Cycle of vitamins look like?
25:59
And if we reimagine a vitamin as a lifestyle product. So then to your point, it's like, "All right, well, it's
26:04
got to be a square pack." And then I I always want to design everything to have like a So again, it's really designed as
26:11
a product, not a package. So I wanted to design it like a jar, something you would want to leave out. Uh because if
26:17
you left it out, you most likely remember to keep taking it, but also like it actually had like intrinsic
26:22
value. And then I realized, okay, well, we have to put a giant cap on it, so we might as well make the cap the logo. So
26:28
then the whole idea and this flowed really within a matter of probably days. The idea that it would be a square jar
26:34
with a white cap and that's what would make it iconic and then it just started quickly flowing from there of like well
26:40
everybody else is selling like why sell biotin? Why not just sell beauty? Why
26:45
sell melatonin? Why not sell sleep and do these really unique blends? And again, it was all the spirit of really
26:52
making this thing easier to understand that almost, you know, again, turning an an a vitamin into something you have to
26:59
buy into something you want to buy in this little like object of desire. That's amazing. Uh we didn't talk about
27:05
the hustle that it takes to make them happen cuz there's like the artist brain that you're talking about. You're like, "So then I took the the roof of the
27:12
Japanese, you know, hut I was staying in and that became the lid and then I did this and I did that." But now you just
27:17
have a product idea at that point. A a box. But like you know the cool thing about
27:22
Exactly. A beautiful box though. Don't get me wrong. The best the best box. Best box. People love this box. So you But you
27:30
know all entrepreneurs they they're typically not like the best in the world at a single thing, but they're like
27:36
pretty damn good at a couple of unrelated things. So, you know, maybe there's better designers than you or product product designers than you, but
27:43
you also have the entrepreneurial hustle to be like, I'm going to go now stand outside of this natural grocery store
27:49
and pass out samples or I'm going to go do a thing that's like I'm going to keep showing up in some way that like other
27:57
people would have given up 5 days ago, but I was still here and that was the thing that gave me the break. You know, you're top 20% in two different things
28:03
rather than being top 1% or top.1% in a single category. I'm just assuming that.
28:08
Is that true? And are there any stories of the hustle that it took to get to get into the stores actually get the
28:13
momentum? Yeah, super true. It is funny. It's like I as an entrepreneur, I think a lot about energy flow. And when I'm working
28:18
on something, if it's giving me energy back, then I know it's right. And to your earlier comment of if it's hard,
28:24
it's wrong. That's a lot of the way. And I'm working on a concept right now that I've literally been pushing water uphill.
28:30
It's been painful as far as trying it. But but last week it broke. I'm like, "Oh, there it is now. Now it's flowing
28:37
re like I can't stop working on it right now because it's energy giving it's flowing the narrative is like beautifully coming together each
28:43
insight's unlocking the next but in that case like I had to push water uphill for like the last 6 months on this concept
28:51
trying to get it to a place where suddenly like I can see see it now and then hopefully other people will see it
28:56
but to your point of execution like at the end of the day like ideas are are easy like execution's the hard part. So
29:03
with method, I think that was where we had because we had, you know, we're Adam and I were two guys in a dirty flat in
29:08
San Francisco with like zero no, you know, zero experience on how to make or sell anything. And um I think where that
29:15
persistence really paid off is we had to sell it into these, you know, local San Francisco grocery stores where the
29:21
manager made the decision. So, you would just show up at 6:00 a.m. and like, you know, grumpy manager and you got, you
29:26
know, quickly you've got literally three minutes to like pitch your idea for this new premium cleaning uh uh uh cleaning
29:33
brand. And I realized a lot of ways selling was just really this transfer of emotion. Like I don't think he ever
29:39
believed in the product that we're selling. But you got to get him to believe in you and in some cases believe
29:45
that you're going to keep showing up until he says yes and that persistence. But it's it's really that emotion, that
29:52
energy that's contagious and it's finding it first in what you're building that you love. So then you can share
29:57
that with other people and have the energy to keep going when things get hard, which of course they will.
30:02
Do you look at a company like a project like this is my art project and I'm going to jump from thing to thing to
30:08
thing. Do you acknowledge like or are you more of a are you more operational? I I both I'm a project guy at heart. I
30:15
love the start, middle, and finish of creating something, but also to build great companies, the operating side of
30:22
it is is so important. The kind of my kind of core philosophy of building companies is this idea of artisan
30:27
operators. So, I want to build companies that have incredible imagination, creativity that can innovate, but also
30:34
run a really good predictable business with great supply chain, finance, controls, and doing both. Like if you
30:40
think about it, there's so few companies in the world, Apple, Nike, that do both
30:45
really, really well at scale. And so I try to build teams and cultures that
30:51
have this idea of being great artisan operators. Um, but I do, you know, at the heart of it, I do love, you know, I
30:57
I heard Tim Cougall, who was on my board, say once, he referred to Yahoo as a project, you know, which he started as
31:03
employee number six, the CEO, scaled it through an IPO and beyond. And when he referred to Yahoo as a project, I
31:10
thought that was pretty cool. Do you have like an open an open check from Unilever or Target and they're just
31:15
like whatever you got going on, uh, get after it and come see us in two or three years and we'll look at the traction and
31:21
we'll just buy your company. I wish it was that easy, but no.
31:26
So said the guy like in his chair with a cat on his on his arm, right?
31:31
I mean, we've had a lot of success. We've had a lot of failures as well. it always like every every one of them is
31:38
hard and and hard in their own way. I do so I'm moving over I joined Greatcraft and we're launching a new uh Greatcraft
31:44
consumer brands fund. So I'm moving into the the VC space and kind of what you're
31:49
talking about too. It's I realize like my superpower of working with entrepreneurs is to to to help infuse
31:55
them in energy because you know I've sat in their shoes so many times and understand how hard it is. And so I I
32:02
love now not being the the quarterback on the field, always throwing the passes, but actually being the coach on
32:07
the sidelines and like coaching these these young founders. And um it's it's
32:12
just a thrill to do that. Now, you told me something kind of amazing. You said that you went on your trend
The State of Make
32:18
trips, let's say, to Tokyo or wherever you're going, and you took some people from Target with you during this kind of
32:25
like brainstorming phase, but then you had this this system that was kind of like going to wow them. Can you tell the
32:30
story about how you the 24-hour cycle that you had that would like wow them? Yeah, I mean a lot of people, you know,
32:36
trend trips are quite common within consumer, especially among retailers. The problem is you come back with all
32:42
these amazing photos and then you're buried in your inbox and meetings you've missed and usually it goes nowhere. So
32:48
the process that we found worked really well is we'd kick off every trend trip with like, okay, here are, you know,
32:54
ground ourselves. These are the big macro trends. And then we'd hire somebody on the ground where for Asia,
32:59
Europe, um, and we would go to all of like the most influential retail that was occurring in that market. But
33:07
everybody had almost like a scavenger hunt. You had an assignment. By the time we got to that pub at 5:00 to sit down
33:13
for for happy hour, everybody had to have multiple ideas that they were excited about while being in the field.
33:20
And then we would talk about it. We would pick a couple and then as we're going to dinner, I would call it into
33:25
our creative team who's sitting in San Francisco where it's morning. And then they would have all day to work on the
33:31
brief that we just gave them. They would send it at the end of their day. We would wake up and then at breakfast we
33:36
would present like what looked like polished products ideas to Target. And so by the time we got on that plane to
33:42
go home, we actually had sold in u new products. That's like how South Park makes an
33:47
episode. Have you guys seen that? Where like Matt and Trey will like write all day and then they'll like send it to
33:53
their Korean editor editing team and then the next morning they like, "Oh, cool. Thanks." And they like run with
33:58
it. I saw the podcast version of this, Sam. So we we do a thing where uh whenever we
34:03
have a guest on or like especially when we do them in person, we will bring a gift and cuz I was just like oh you know
34:08
like this person took time out of their day or did this like I want this to feel like a great experience like what makes a great experience when you when you
34:15
have when you when you are with somebody I think giving a gift is a nice thing right Steve Bartlett who's another
34:20
podcaster he he was on uh Jimmy Fallon the other day and Jimmy was talking about how his experience on the show he goes you guys do this incredible thing I
34:27
did the podcast with you and when we got up and the episode was done. Somebody from your team came and handed me this
34:33
book and it's a photo book of printed photos from the podcast that they were just doing like moments earlier. And he
34:40
was like, I've never seen anything like this. And this guy's been doing TV production with Hollywood stars for for
34:45
years, but like the creating like going the little bit extra to create a wow. And in that case, it's the speed of the
34:51
turnaround. Similar to what you were saying with your the speed of the turnaround. I'm sure a lot of people will come up with mock-ups or product
34:57
ideas 2 weeks later at a follow-up meeting, but the emotion's gone and the wow factor is gone at that point. Doing
35:03
it in the 24-hour cycle is is that little extra that entrepreneurial juice that like I think most people wouldn't
35:09
wouldn't even think to go. They wouldn't they would think that's there's an invisible fence that you can't do that.
35:15
Well, it's living that state of make. And also, I love that line by Steve Jobs of uh I trust people just not in groups.
35:23
And so it allows you to keep a really small team that's agile that isn't
35:28
overthinking things and just living in that state of make. And that's that's where magic and I'm I'm such a huge
35:34
student of SNL and how Saturday Night Live their entire creative process any any of the former actors on it that's
35:40
written an autobiography I've listened to like I think I know it by heart now of like what they do Tuesday morning
35:45
through. But there is something so powerful about being in that state of make. And now that we have between AI
35:51
and digital tools where we could build and make things in such real time, I think it's even more powerful. And it's
35:56
also where you see real talent um versus people who who don't know how to actually do anything. They know how to
36:02
manage. And so it's a place where like builders and doers really thrive and managers kind of just get in the way.
36:08
I don't I don't I don't know if we should do it right now, which maybe have a part two, but it would actually be awesome. I never realized uh for like
36:15
you know Sean has an an ecom brand and um for all the people who are in the in the more physical space it would be
36:20
really fun to see how you use AI to ideulate uh that that would be really interesting. I've never thought about
36:26
about you know folks making physical products being able or not being able to use it. Oh I'm use I'm so bad with right now
36:33
like last night just I used it as a whole creative team and partner thought it's it's absolutely amazing what you
36:38
can do. Now I want to get to the brainstorm. So we did we did promise I basically said
36:43
outline your method and then let's use the method to try to come up with some ideas which I think is fun living in the
36:48
state of make on the podcast too right because how many podcasts would actually try that okay so you just to outline
36:54
your your process was find a big category ideally an already big category so you don't have to educate the
36:59
consumer about something new they haven't thought about buying you want to find a sea of sameness where everybody's
37:04
kind of doing the same thing you want to look if there's a cultural shift elsewhere that hasn't applied to this category Ideally, it's something that's
37:11
overly complicated. They're taking themselves too seriously. Then to come up with your idea, you be a thief. You
37:17
find unrelated things. You say, "What if we did that over here, and you're trying to come up with a single stroke that cuts through the noise that might be
37:23
your packaging or your your colors, your positioning, whatever it may be, this the square bottle when everybody else is
37:28
round. Um, and then you got to hustle to get the momentum going." All right. So, I came up with a couple of half I'm
37:33
calling these halfbaked ideas. I don't think they're I think one might be good, but the others are are uh are pretty tough. Uh, did you have a chance to come
37:40
up with some? And if so, let's we'll go back and forth. Yes. Yep. I got a couple. Okay. I'm gonna pitch you one and then I
37:46
want you to to, you know, give me the the the thumbs up, the thumbs down. Feel free to be brutally harsh. It makes for
37:52
better content. All right. All right. I think this this first idea I think is genuinely good. The other ones I don't really have a lot
IDEA: A better Metamucil
37:58
of faith in, but this one I genuinely believe in. All right. So, I think about products that my mom takes that I'm
38:03
going to take because humans are not like the world, you know, feels like it's changing really fast, but
38:08
biologically we're not changing that fast, right? And so, when I see my parents, I'm seeing a future window into
38:15
what I might look like or things that they prioritize that I don't really think about today. And my mom was just
38:20
over at my house and one thing my mom takes religiously is fiber. She drinks
38:25
fiber every single day. And I've, you know, I'm in a world where I hear about gut health and microbiome and fancy
38:31
stuff, but she's like, I need to take this to poop. Okay, so that's what I'm gonna do. And I need to take this to
38:37
poop. You got that? I'm like, yeah, that's simple enough. And so then I looked I looked at the brands that she's using and I walk
38:43
through the aisle. So preparing for this podcast, I went to the grocery store and I walked through and I see Metamucil,
38:49
which to me sounds like a disease. I see Benafiber, which sounds like an Obamacare, you know, spin-off. And I
38:55
just thought the brand, the leading brands in the fiber category, I think are completely outdated, but I do think
39:01
that there's something familiar about fiber. So like I get pitched a lot of products that I don't really know if they'll work or not. But if somebody
39:07
said, "Hey, this increases the fiber in your diet." I would personally have pretty high conviction that that's like good for me. I just don't want to take a
39:15
grandma product, right? Because that's not really that wouldn't I would feel unhealthy taking the product. So, I want
39:21
a fiber brand that I feel like I'm in the same way when I take, you know, uh,
39:27
protein or amino acids or something that's like, yeah, I'm at I'm trying to be peak performance right now. And so, I
39:33
want to reinvent the fiber category. That's the point of view. And I have an idea for how to do that, which is to to
39:39
get out of this kind of grandma product category and do a fresh take on fiber sharks. All right.
39:44
Where do you where's that land with you? Well, let's start with the space because it's if it's the wrong category, then
39:50
there's it's pointless to go any further. I I think he found great white space. Like I agree, fiber is the new
39:56
protein. As protein gets more and more saturated and the rec, you know, uh we're seeing
40:04
huge growth across all all areas of higher fiber. If you the place I would look is if you walk Costco and what
40:11
fiber products are available there. And you're right, it's the legacy brands. Nobody's really put a fresh spin on it.
40:18
You could do it like where would you steal from? I would steal from juice bars of like that wellness appetite
40:25
appeal like a green ju like what is a green ju a modern green juice look like
40:30
as a fiber product and then you can innovate on flavors around it. Um and
40:36
the other thing is it's a really great margin category, right? We uh I have this friend. Do you guys
40:42
know what kele exercises are for men? I don't know how to do it. You're supposed to like squeeze something inside, but like
40:48
women have women have women anyone the few women who listen to this, they know what that is. But for men,
40:54
all four of you listen up. This part's for you. Yeah. For for the men, people apparently do kele exercises so don't like
41:00
premature ejaculate basically during sex. I think that's the main thing. But there but I have a I've got a buddy who
41:05
who made a That's commitment by the way. Well, I've got Yeah. Yeah. Like you must you really need it. And I have a friend
41:12
who created a Keele exercise app for men. And he was like promoting this. And
41:17
I was like, man, I see why young or any man wants this. That's great. It sounds
41:22
like you're doing great for the world, but my honor costs too much. I don't want to be an influencer or a promoter
41:28
for this. And I wonder if there's like a little bit with fiber where it's like I don't know if I want to talk about like,
41:34
you know, pooping more. So, I did think about this. And I have two two possible angles. We either lean
41:40
in or we swerve out. Okay, lean in. Here's the lean path. People think that the lean-in path is gonna be, look, poop
41:47
is, you know, poop is poop's poop. It kind of could be funny. And so I actually pitched this to our friend who
41:53
came on the podcast, Hust Minhash. I said, "Listen, I got a product for you." Cuz I was like, "This guy's so funny that like his ad creative would be like
42:00
would perform better than anybody else's ad creative." And it's almost like, you know, any celebrity who hawks a product,
42:06
there's a little bit of a sellout nature. And so it's almost funny to sell out for something that's like so like so
42:14
clearly silly and in that way that it might actually work for him. Like he's gets a license to like promote the
42:20
product because it's kind of a silly product. Um so one I one way is to lean in and actually have a comedian who you
42:26
kind of uh have as a face of the brand that actually leans into the fun of it. You could be the dude the dude wipes
42:33
leaned into that to the use case. All right. So then there's the swerve out path which was you're right maybe it's not about maybe
42:40
it's not about uh maybe the framing is a little more on metabolism or digestion like you you may can you word can you
42:45
use a different word because I don't know anybody that likes worse metabolism yeah like cleaner system and I've never heard really of that many
42:51
products that like talk about like this this improves your metabolism right and so you get away from the sort of like
42:58
the the lower intestine area and you you sort of like you move up towards more like the stomach and you get a little
43:04
away from the growth stuff and you talk about metabolism. So those are my two ideas. I love it. And what I would do if I were you, I would then create two very
43:12
different concepts around that. So I would do like like dude white popery approach that just like unbashfully
43:21
claims that that function and then to your point then I would go to a really elevated almost like beauty
43:26
like approach. And then what would you do? Would you test those in some way or you just look at it and feel which one feels right?
43:32
like what would you do once you come up with the two very disperate concepts? So, I like to solve the work in the
43:38
creative. And so, I'd take those two concepts, I'd work with with a designer and creative team, really bring them to
43:44
life, and then first I'd be like, what one am I most excited about? Back to that idea of energy. Like, which one am
43:49
I like personally excited? I would share with friends and family because if they don't like it, why would anybody else?
43:54
And then if I was really torn, I would do consumer auditions. not for the consumer to like choose A versus B, but
44:00
just so I can hear feedback from consumers like in a qualitative focus group to help kind of guide my decision
44:06
of which direction I want to go. And then I would also put it in front of retailers. I don't ask the buyers. I think most people go into buyers with
44:12
the intent of like I'm going to sell to you. I'm here to prove myself versus I'm here to improve myself. And when I sit
44:18
down with buyers, I always try to go in to improve and and really invite their feedback into the process.
44:24
That's interesting. Consumer auditions. I never heard that. That That sounds good. I like that. That sounds way cooler than focus groups.
44:30
All right, rookie. Uh, what do you what do you got to pitch, Eric? Let's hear it. Okay, so I'm going to pitch arguably one of
IDEA: The SoulCycle of diners
44:37
the most important institutions in America and arguably one of the lost institutions of America and that is the
44:45
American diner. at one point these beautiful you know silver and it was
44:52
really the third you know the first third place before Starbucks and in a world where more and more I think we'll
44:59
see a backlash to AI of understanding what is real and what is not we're going to want these places of human connection
45:06
and just deep authenticity and there's also no better place than to really
45:11
start your day so my pitch is I'm going to go back to soul cycle again I create
45:17
the soul cycle of the diner. It would only be open from morning through lunch.
45:22
So, it's one shift. So, it's a really good academic model, but when you walk into it, it feels incredibly vibrant.
45:30
So, I would do probably like the entire thing would feel almost like a modern barn of like white beboard with yellow
45:37
accents. I would have a standalone graband go juice bar, coffee bar. Uh,
45:43
but the rest of the restaurant would be how a diner is set up where it's all stool bar seating, but I would have it
45:50
so it moves throughout, you know, so the counter, there's no separate tables. The
45:55
counter kind of flows so you can get everybody around the counter for that communal, but also so it's really
46:01
efficient for the staff too to move through it. And then when you pop in at 7 a.m., like it's popping. Like it's got
46:07
great great energy. It's just a place you would want to start every morning. Um, right.
46:13
With that level of optimism. So, the seating is kind of like those sushi bars where you where you where they wrap around like the you know those
46:19
conveyor belt sushi bars. You're sort of stealing from that but applying that to the American diner.
46:24
Yes. There's that I forgot the name of it that Pisian restaurant that um where the entire restaurant is built like a
46:31
counter but the counter kind of meanders so you have a full view of the kitchen and then it's very communal. It's in and
46:36
out. you don't have to seed anybody and it's also about creating this amazing energy. So, what I would want to do is
46:42
take on Denny's and IHOP with that model. That's awesome. I have a um since we're
46:49
in a creative brainstorm here, I got a what if for you. I got a I got a how might we for you. You know what I mean? I feel like I need I feel like I need a
46:55
hack sack or something creative with me here. But, okay. So, in mobile gaming,
47:01
uh, I tried to make a a mobile game once. And so, before I even made the game, I went and talked to a couple guys who made really popular mobile games,
47:08
and I sat down and I showed them a prototype, and they go, "Oh, dude, you
47:14
have a TTF problem." And I was like, "I don't know if that's a STD. I don't know what you're talking about, but I I don't
47:19
want a TTF problem, but I'm sure I'm absolutely certain I have one based on the way you just He
47:25
was like disgusted with You're like, uh, oh, thanks." like I work really hard.
47:30
Like, you know, do I have too much or too little? What's the which way do I go? So, he was basically saying the most
47:36
important um metric in a mobile game success is TTF, time to fun. So, basically from the moment I click the
47:43
button to open the app, how long does it take for me to have some fun? Um because
47:48
I was like, "Cool, open the app. Registration screen. Sign up. Give me your email address. How about your phone
47:53
number? Would you like push notifications? Would you like me to remind you?" It's like you haven't even tried the app yet, right? You're like how you're like what's my
47:59
TTS? Like never. The fun never came. There was no fun. And he was showing me like you know if you open up like Mario
48:05
is one of the the classic examples of this. Like if you start Mario first level there's no tutorial. There's no
48:11
nothing. Like Mario starts and a small gloomba starts walking towards you and the easiest enemy to defeat and if you
48:16
jump on his head you get a satisfying like yeah I squashed that bug. And then the next thing you do is there's a brick
48:22
above your head. You jump up, you punch it and you get a coin. You jump up, you punch the next one, you think it's a coin. No, a mushroom comes out. You're
48:28
like, "Oh my god, do I want this?" And you go get it, and you grow. And so in the first 15 seconds of Mario, you have
48:34
learned all the controls. You've defeated an enemy. You've gotten money. And you grew bigger and stronger. And
48:39
it's like the greatest first 15 seconds of your life. So I have an idea for you cuz I went to a diner this weekend.
48:45
Wait, hold on. Can we use like that time time to fund like that's a new metric I'm going to use for everything now. Whether you're
48:50
like and it's like getting a restaurant, airline, my marriage like son time to fun is off right now.
48:57
Exactly. But it's like yeah removing all the friction to get to that experience. Time to funload
49:03
a little bit of the fun, right? I'm not going to give you all of it, but can I get a piece of it here now because I
49:08
need to, you know, hook you. And so I thought I went to a diner this weekend and from the time we got there and we
49:14
were all excited to get there and my kids wanted pancakes and all this good stuff to the time we actually had anything fun like any food or drink on
49:21
the table was like 22 minutes. And I get it, they were totally busy. But I wonder if there's some way where right when you
49:27
walk in there's something because right after the diner we went to Costco and right when we walked in there was like a
49:33
Costco sample person and my kids got something and they were like, "Hey, what is this place? we like this place. Uh
49:39
because they instantly got like a cracker when they walked in. And so I just wonder if with the diner you could do one thing which is like eliminate the
49:45
weight and bring that TTF down, which is what we want. We want low TTF. I love that. Okay. So what I think is
49:51
like you know like Dunkin Donut Munchkins. We do like a really great like gourmet cinnamon munchkin. So when
49:59
you walk in like it's almost like a sample. You grab a munchkin as you walk in to go sit down. So you get that first
50:04
like little taste. Do they have a smell too? because that would be nice double get to get two senses you but you can do a smoothie
50:11
shot next to it. So it's a tray of smoothie shots and munchkins. So So it gives you that little and also takes the
50:17
edge off your customers while they're waiting as well. So the wait time will never feel as long. Two other little culinary steels maybe. Okay. One other
50:24
steel we could do Five Guys. They have the barrel of peanuts which I think is kind of what you're talking about, right? You go in and there's just free
50:29
peanuts you could scoop. Again, I I love that. Who doesn't love that? The other thing I
50:35
my first business was a sushi restaurant and in a sushi a traditional sushi restaurant when you walk through the door.
50:41
The entire kitchen staff they don't turn to you but they hear the door chime go
50:46
and they go and like the whole c like the whole crew is like oh what's up it's
50:52
basically like the Japanese what's up and it basically means like a customer is here like hey like pay attention or
50:57
whatever or welcome. I don't even know what means but like that's what they all say. I think you could also like kind of
51:03
if you talk about soul cycle, I think there's a way to make the experience of the customer interesting when you walk
51:08
in. Like I just wonder what ritual we could have when somebody walks through the door that would be welcoming and unique and interesting. Um, as well,
51:16
we're just such ne we're so ne we're Neanderthalss. Like, you know, we're going to talk about like Aristotle and
51:22
the philosophy philosophy of life and all this stuff. And it turns out you just got to throw a bunch of nuts at my face when I walk in to get a burger.
51:28
Like, dude, I love a good high five. Yeah. You just got to say what's up in Japanese and like I'm good.
51:36
I mean, you can picture the playlist in this place, right, of like the best morning music and there's something of
51:42
like they hit something and like a good morning, good morning comes over as people walk as each time somebody walks
51:47
in the door, right? I love that time. I'm so fascinated with time to fund out. I think about like vacations like going skiing. Time to
51:55
fund could be really low. schleing to get to the hotel. That sucks. Yeah. But everything now I'm going to measure
52:01
in TTF. Well, like you know, you you arrive in Hawaii and they give you the lay right when you get out the door, right? Like a
52:06
hotel check-in process, right? So that normally you the fun is when you get to maybe your room and Hawaii soon as you
52:12
get out the door. Lei blue drink fun instant. Sean, do you just have like a notepad of
52:18
like all low like do you have a ranking of low T? So it just you know what I mean?
52:23
Creative the arrival. There's my boyfriend always say there's nothing better than arrival drinks. Yeah.
52:29
Like that's the best moment of a vacation. Would you ever get into a non I mean you've done the same category forever.
52:35
Would you ever get into a uh a restaurant business or something that's not what you've done?
52:40
Well, I just tried building a retail business and um was I I think what we built was amazing and I was super proud
52:47
of it and it was working with the consumer. It was just impossible to fund in this uh in this current capital
52:52
cycle. So, what I try to do is reinvent the American jewelry store. And my theory was I always wanted to do retail
52:58
where I could, you know, geek out on every expression from the playlist to the scents, which we did. And even the
53:05
way you're greeted, um, and I I'm a huge, you know, student of like Danny Meyer and the way he thinks about at each restaurant, like 15 seconds, right,
53:11
to be greeted and and even the service mandle, where does a salt and pepper go and how do you think every every detail
53:17
through? But when you walk into a jewelry store, I found it to be like the most intimidating experience. It's like
53:22
you never felt like you belonged there. You had to like ask for the world's smallest price tag to be turned over and then you have to give a reaction to
53:29
something you thought was 5,000 but it's actually 50,000. And the insight there was women self-purchasing is driving
53:35
growth in fine jewelry but nobody was really creating a experience for them. So we created this brand called Cast.
53:41
Um, we opened up three stores in the Bay Area and I wanted like, you know, Willy
53:46
Wonka, pure imagination to play in a consumer's head when they walked in and and feel like a kid in a candy store
53:51
again. Um, but again, get being able to sign leases, uh, build out stores, omni
53:58
channel. We had incredible partnership with Nordstrom who put capital in the business, but it was so capital
54:03
intensive that like a path to profitability and then raising capital in this market was just incredibly
54:10
incredibly difficult. That's where those one of those situations you're like, "All right, I'm sitting at the wrong uh Tony Shay would
54:15
say sometimes you got to move poker tables and just I'm at the wrong table and you know, gold pricing was spiking,
54:21
diamond pricing was crashing. You couldn't sign a lease in these A class cuz LVM should eat up so much of the
54:27
these these leases." Um, so I realized like it was just back to like if it's hard, it's wrong. Um, it was a hard work
54:35
on it until you were like, "All right, it's it's it's dead." I worked on it from launch to it's dead.
54:43
Uh yeah, three three to four years. Oh, a lot. A lot. Yeah. No, we we worked we worked out
54:48
hard at it. It was a fun business like designing jewelry and our te you know, incredible culture, our team, Issa Ray
54:54
was part of it and uh we're on the white lotus season 2. Um the cast was wearing our product.
55:00
We had a, you know, we had a profound market in the industry in a very short amount of time, but it just was a
55:06
business that nobody wants to put capital into, unfortunately, and there's never been really great. It's not like the easiest uh pitch at
55:12
the moment, like, okay, so how are you an AI company? Uh, yeah. I mean, it's not like very appealing.
55:17
Sammy, you know, he has like great phrases. He had one on on this when he was telling me about the jewelry shop. He goes, "It was like a plane made of
55:24
gold." Like, I love like it was a great idea, but it was like a plane made of gold. You couldn't it couldn't get lift off. It couldn't get off the ground. I
55:29
was stupid. No matter how fast this thing went down the runway, like it just could not get air airborne. And uh but if you look at
55:37
it, it's cast jewelry our store. I mean, I was super proud of what we built, but um I picked a I picked the wrong space to
55:43
try to innovate in. Sean, do you want to tell them more of your horrible ideas or Okay, I got I got another one here.
55:50
You think I had one bad idea? I'm a volume guy. No, your first one was a great idea. I
55:56
would invest. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So, now here's it's about to fall off a cliff here. Okay. So, uh I walked through the
IDEA: White label chicken
56:02
grocery store looking for that sea of sameness. And honestly, like you know, shout out to the grocery store. There's
56:08
there wasn't a whole a lot of categories that I saw. One that stood out to me because I'm looking for everyday products. I'm looking for repeat
56:14
purchase. I'm looking for everybody buys this, but I'm looking for something where there's not a brand. I don't have
56:20
a favorite brand. I don't have even like I don't couldn't even tell you the name of four of the brands in the category.
56:25
That's kind of what I was looking for. So, I'd like you like to introduce you to my uh company, White Label Chicken
56:31
LLC. And White Label Chicken LLC is getting into the chicken game. And what we're
56:36
going to do is we're going to white label someone else's chicken. So, we're going to take chicken from somebody else. We're not going to get into farming, but we're going to put our own
56:44
brand on it because there like Sam, what's your top three favorite chicken brands?
56:49
I don't know. Don't know. Eric, you got a favorite chicken brand? What about like packaged chicken? Packaged chicken. You're going to go buy
56:56
like breast meat or whatever. It's like nine bucks for the the little mini tray. Yeah, that's a real That's a wear
57:01
inspiring name. Well, we're not The front facing brand is not White Label Chicken. It's a It's a working title. And so we're White
57:08
Label Chicken LLC. And so then I I don't even know the angle yet. I All I knew was I can't believe there's no like
57:14
there's no Oat Leaf for chicken. No. You know what I mean? There's there's no there's no I can't believe there's just
57:19
not a f like not like distinct chicken brands that stand for something and mean
57:25
something like whether it's whether it's about the flavor or preseason whether it's about like this is man's chicken
57:31
and like you're going to get your protein from this meal like this is what we do we we give you a little extra I don't know what it is but I just kind of
57:38
saw that white space and I wanted to open the floor to you gentlemen to help me kind of workshop this
57:43
point this is where it goes like familiar and uh novel So this is very familiar. So how do you add novelty?
57:49
It's interesting. You're right. As soon as it gets like put in a dinosaur shape and breadcrumbs around it, it becomes,
57:56
you know, dino like it becomes dino nuggets becomes incredibly well branded
58:01
or it gets served at a restaurant as a a sandwich Chick-fil-A. But the the the
58:07
chicken itself, I mean, it was f like Foster Farms did a pretty good job of this
58:13
um on Cal out in California, but it was really not the product. It's just their advertising was so good, right?
58:18
That Goodbye did years ago. Okay. So, I think you got to go back. I would sell I
58:25
would turn it into an origin story. I wouldn't sell the chicken. I would sell the farm
58:31
and I would That sounds smart, right? This far is like
58:36
sounds cool. I wish I had said that. As if Don Draper wore hoodies.
58:41
Don't sell the chicken, sell the farm. Baby, I might say that to my wife later today in any context.
58:47
Eric, do you have like a pack of sigs that you could light up right now? Cuz if you took out a cigarette right now,
58:52
you would be the coolest man I've ever met in my life after that line. Put your feet up, smoke a sig, and tell
58:58
me about selling the farm, not the chicken. Because the
59:03
because we don't want to think about the chicken because we murdered it, right? We want to think that the chicken had a good life on this farm before it was
59:10
killed, right? That's going to make us feel good about the quality of the chicken. It's going to make us feel good about the chicken's
59:17
short life. And so I would build the whole brand around
59:23
this heaven, this heavenly farm for chickens. What if we create an Instagram account? We actually pour all our energy into the
59:29
Instagram account of this incredibly aesthetic farm and it's like Truman Show. It's just
59:35
totally a set. Uh cuz again, we're white label Chicken LLC. So, uh I'm starting with inauthenticity here, but like I'm
59:41
just thinking what if we what if you started with the the social and you just
59:46
made everybody's favorite farm and then from there you're like of course if you're going to buy chicken, you'd buy
59:51
it from your favorite farm. Dude, I have a um I've got a friend that exited a um
59:56
a multi-billion dollar consumer brand and I was I Yeah, he So he's he's
1:00:02
He thinks you're his best friend, but he's just a friend. Yeah, he might he might use the a word
1:00:07
acquaintance. Um and and I use, you know, close friend. Yeah, close friend. Yeah, we're a little
1:00:13
bit different, but we uh he was like telling me this idea for his new business and presumably he's very smart
1:00:18
because of his previous success, but he was like, "Do you know what free range means?" like freerange chicken. And I was like, I guess that means they're
1:00:24
they're running around a farm. And he was like, no, the definition is like they've got like a cage the size of like
1:00:29
5x5. It was I I forget the exact definition, but it was like shockingly small. And he's working on this thing where he's putting RFD is it called RFD
1:00:36
tags? Is that what it's called? Uh the is that what it is? He was putting them in in cows and in chickens. And as they
1:00:45
are scanned, so the whole farm has like the the technology to see how far away
1:00:50
they're running. And as they go to the kill, you know, the kill bin or whatever they got to go to, their their RFD thing
1:00:55
is scanned. And so a consumer can on his chickens, this is a real thing that he's he already built, you can see how like
1:01:02
what radius they were running around. This was his whole premise is that people which it kind of that could maybe
1:01:09
that that actually might be interesting but you could actually see is this truly freerange chicken or were they just like
1:01:14
in a small pen where they were just in their own feces like you know like because there's like a a correlation between how like healthy the farm was
1:01:21
and how if they actually followed the rules. Yeah. And I think to build an area too I always say the framework of like you got
1:01:27
to find that intersection of altruism and narcissism. So the case of method you bought it for very narcissist
1:01:33
reasons. You love the fragrance, you love the design of it, but the altruism, it's good for me, good for the planet,
1:01:38
brought you coming back. And if you can deliver on both, I think is real power. We try to do that in all of our brands.
1:01:43
So, in the case of our chicken farm here, we need to sell the narcissism
1:01:49
that this is the most organic, good for you, great tasting chicken, but the altruism that you can feel good that
1:01:55
this chicken, while they had a short life, it had a really good life. And I think it was a great six weeks.
1:02:02
Yeah. You know, it's almost like you you you steal from children's books. So, you you you do the whole branding like it's
1:02:08
a children's book of this magical farm and even like you make the farmers who
1:02:14
work there kind of, you know, part of the overall like iconography, the brand and you make them heroes in it as well.
1:02:21
Old McDonald had a farm. It's called Bingo Chicken. Is Old McDonald's available?
1:02:27
Chicken. Old McDonald's would be great. Old McDonald if that's available. Does anybody own that?
1:02:33
I think because McDonald you'd have to be like old, you know, McDonald. You have to like do something weird with the
1:02:39
spelling. Do you guys ever buy these eggs? Yeah, all the time. Yes. Yeah. They're in my fridge right now. I use it.
1:02:44
This is like what you're talking about of like the sea of sameness or like the commodities that they made. Like look at the bottom here. Medium brown egg is
1:02:52
literally the name of the product. It's like a transparent medical packaging, like sterile packaging. And you just see
1:02:58
these eggs and then this vital farms thing on top because they literally draw
1:03:03
like flowers and like you know hay or whatever on the thing. I'm like oh farm
1:03:08
good arm to table. I'm doing good. Now that he says see a savveness I'm like oh I do this all the time. Like I the other
1:03:14
day I bought yogurt the other day because instead of Greek yogurt this yogurt was Icelandic,
1:03:20
right? Like I don't know. Like I do know what that means but I'm in. Yeah. Yeah. I was like, "For some
1:03:26
reason, it's all Greek and this is from Iceland." And do you have a theory on naming cuz like
Holy Grail of Naming
1:03:31
you've named your products extremely well. Um how how do you come up with names? Uh so the holy grail of naming is one
1:03:40
word, four letters. If you can do it that really really hard. Naming a brand
1:03:45
is the most difficult part of a startup because everything is taken. Do you use like an agency? Do you just
1:03:51
sit there and think? It's all different. I'm not good at naming, but I'm good at spotting a name. So, method was Adam was literally my
1:03:58
co-founder. We were literally brushing our teeth at the same time and he's like, "What about method?" I was like, "That's it." Lawyer is like, "You're
1:04:04
never going to get method. It's like way too generic." Then I asked my lawyer while he wasn't working over drinks. I
1:04:10
was like, "If if you thought this name was really important to your success, what would you do?" He's like, "Hey, I'd go for it." Like, where's Because
1:04:16
lawyers never want to be wrong, but they don't need to be right. Um uh Ali came
1:04:21
from I was working with Alan Dy who was helping me who's creative director at Apple and we came up with Ali Slate like
1:04:27
Ali for friendly. I wanted I wanted to name with each case I come up with a jumping off word. So for method I wanted
1:04:33
to represent technique right so if you're in the gym you use good technique to get force because this was going to
1:04:39
clean without force. So I was like we want something that represents technique and he's like how about method I was like that's it. Um, with Ali, everything
1:04:47
in the category was pseudocience like uh, uh, Centrum or was very folksy like
1:04:53
nature's garden or bounty. So, I wanted a name that just sounded friendly. So, he came up with Ali Slate and then we
1:05:00
realized Ali just we were able to get it on its own. So, we didn't need the slate part of it. You're like ripping through the story and it's like insight insight
1:05:08
insight and like you you you make it you you have what I call the knowledge like the curse of knowledge which is
1:05:13
you think that this is you're like oh yeah I just did this and then I just did that and I don't think
1:05:19
you didn't even tell us that and that was so interesting and what if we hadn't asked the question we wouldn't have known that like how many more of those
1:05:25
you got because like you're like oh well I just do this of course as one does you pick a jump off word and then you I like
1:05:32
oh I don't do anything like that I But like you know someone's a master when they when they're fluid they're
1:05:38
fluid with this and and and it's incredibly clear when you describe the simplest things that you are
1:05:44
the jumping off word for uh for well so for Wellie was uh I wanted something
1:05:50
about healthcare and so we actually came up with night and gale. So, Night and Gale because of the idea of like Night
1:05:56
and Gale is like she is like this icon and it's all about caring for you and uh
1:06:02
uh Anthony Spurduty and Partners and Spade came up with Wellie and I was like like it done most every time I've never
1:06:09
every name like cast we came up with for jewelry for again each time we I I saw
1:06:16
the name it was like no debate it was like that is it and it's all hands-on how do we secure this name. Amazing. Do you have another idea?
IDEA: Gourmet Babybels
1:06:23
One of my favorite foods and I watch my kids go through it is packaged cheese.
1:06:29
So the craft singles, mozzarella sticks. I have never seen anybody do anything
1:06:37
really. So there's this big delta in cheese too. You go to like the artisal cheese
1:06:44
uh counter, right? It is it's art for and we have this place. We live on Shelter Island summer and this guy
1:06:49
Andrew runs the cheese wagon. It's literally a wagon and my wife and I will go there every few days just cuz we'll
1:06:55
sit there and taste the cheese with him and it's like wine. He just romances it. So the the gap is if you look at all the
1:07:02
categories that have have taken a more artisian approach and then you go shop
1:07:08
packaged cheese, it's the same thing. It's cheddar. It's like mozzarella. It has not changed. And I love my favorite
1:07:15
packaging form in the world are those baby bells, right? In the wax like little Pac-Mans that you split apart.
1:07:21
So my idea is I want to create a line of gourmet cheeses in the in the you know
1:07:28
in the prepackage in those baby bell wax forms, but do really like take what
1:07:34
they've started and go super gourmet with different flavor profiles in it and make that that packaging form. I'd make
1:07:42
it slightly bigger, too. Different colors. Um, but I would I would uh build
1:07:47
a whole line of gourmet cheeses around it. And if anybody wants to do this, please reach out to me. Sorry. This is this for You say it's for
1:07:53
kids or it's not for kids? You're just saying I want to do the gourmet cheeses but in the in the in this new packaging
1:07:59
and in that aisle. Yes. Like my my boys love the baby bells. I want to do that for adults.
1:08:06
Again, taking something that's a kid product, but then elevate it as an adult product. And there's just something so
1:08:13
fun about opening up that little wax. It's very sad. Sam, you're a manchild. Where does this land with you, dude? I had three of these. So, I do
1:08:19
what I do what I call redneck fitness food. So, last night I just had three baby bells for dinner and I wrapped it
1:08:25
in salami and just piled them in my mouth. I call it balls of fun. Uh, and
1:08:31
so times of fun's really fast. Who are you telling this name to?
1:08:38
You know, Sam's mouth surprised. I don't know. Are we still work chopping it? I'm not sure yet. Uh
1:08:44
but but you could even squirt a little mustard at this this ball. Uh but yeah, this is great. I love those cheeses. And
1:08:51
I think they only make Gouda and like the normal one. What is it about that packaging? Does it actually cuz it's kind of softer inside,
1:08:58
right? Is it is that because of the type of cheese or does does the packaging do that? Well, I think it's already like that,
1:09:04
but you could just like grab it. It's just like I'll grab them and I'll literally put it in my pocket and like as I'm walking I'll eat a grab and go cheese. Okay. Gotcha.
1:09:11
And it's a single serve. It's a single serve. So like it's like super easy. Uh but yeah, it's definitely a convenience
1:09:16
thing. Not necessarily a it's better tasting thing, but I think there's something very primal too about opening it. So it feels
1:09:23
natural back the wax like opening an orange like you feel like a little monkey just getting into your snack. And
1:09:29
so it's and the time to fun on that is 3 seconds. Yeah. It's oddly It's oddly satisfying whenever I peel back that wax and then
1:09:36
when you peel back the wax on if you ever ever done it, the two things open up and like the top part doesn't fall
1:09:41
off the bottom part of the wrapper. Yeah. You ever seen an oyster? Have you? Yeah. It's like an oyster. Have you guys seen those new Coke
1:09:46
bottles where you twist the cap off and then it peels back and the cap like stays on the bottle? Oh, no. I haven't seen that.
1:09:52
Oh man, it's kind of like that. I love that. Just delightful. I was so you can fully recycle the bottle then because the caps usually
1:09:58
don't get recycled. Now, we might be breaking the laws of physics here, but one of the most satisfying food experiences in the world is cracking the
1:10:04
the top of a Coke can. The sound and the like literally it's like like an iconic sound of of the tab. Um I wonder if
1:10:11
there's a way to like create some sound or satisfying uh crack here. But but I I think I'm I think I'm making a good idea
1:10:18
bad here. You've overinnated it. Yeah. One one iteration.
1:10:23
Yeah. Just blue bell or baby bell, whatever it's called, but fancy cheese. I also had a cheese idea. So, great
IDEA: fun shaped cheese
1:10:30
minds think alike. I also had a cheese idea. Yours is better, but I'm just gonna say mine out loud in case there's something you want to steal out of the
1:10:36
carcass of this idea that I'm about to give you. Um, this is like a dying idea I had. But, um, so my mother-in-law came
1:10:43
over and she's great, but uh, you know, she's got mother-in-law itis a little bit where she's like, "Well, I know the
1:10:49
answers to the test and you're still trying to figure out the answers to the test. So, like, let me just tell you what to do." And so, for example, it'll
1:10:55
be like, "Oh, he'll love this rice. Kids love rice." She'll just say these generic things like, "Kids love rice.
1:11:01
So, your kids going to love rice." I'm like, "No, no, he doesn't eat rice. Doesn't like rice. Blah, blah, blah." Or, you know, milk. Like, one of our
1:11:06
kids wasn't really drinking like milk from like a milk uh like a gallon of milk or whatever. And she was like, "All
1:11:12
kids love milk. Your kid's going to love milk." And we're like, "You can try. Be my guest, but like this kid doesn't
1:11:17
drink milk." And I was waiting for like the satisfaction of being right. And then 5 minutes later, she's like, "Oh,
1:11:25
he loves it." And I'm like, "No way." And I go over and basically what she did was she would pour the milk into the top
1:11:31
of the cap and give him like he got to have a tiny mini cup. And he was like into that. And so he was like, "Oh, like
1:11:38
taking shots of milk like a like a you know, like a spring breaker basically." And I couldn't believe it. And she was
1:11:44
like, "Change of presentation." And so now this phrase change of presentation has become a big deal. So anytime
1:11:49
there's a food my kid doesn't eat, it's not a question of do they like it or not. It's what is the change of presentation we need to do to get them
1:11:55
to eat it. So for example, bread was another didn't want bread. My wife takes a cookie cutter like a like the star
1:12:01
shape or whatever and he gets to stamp out the bread and now he likes that. And we're like, "Oh my god, change of
1:12:07
presentation." So my And now your mother-in-law is the man of the house. Well, I think she already was and I just
1:12:13
was in denial for a period of time. But I too have now bent the knee like the tech CEOs like sucking up to Donald
1:12:19
Trump basically. Like that's me now where I'm like mother. Can we get more gold in this room? Love
1:12:25
it. Um you know so so basically my cheese idea is basically instead of just slices of cheese you include a stamper.
1:12:33
And the stamper is like shapes that they can stamp the cheese into so they can play like play-doh stealing from
1:12:38
Play-Doh. And you basically get the Play-Doh shape cutters, but you apply it to cheese and you sell it together as a
1:12:44
little pack basically. I think my kids would love that. I don't know how scalable that is.
1:12:50
You got to add That's the problem. I don't know.
1:12:56
What about my mother-in-law? Did that come through? Was the audio good on that? when when when slash when we sell
1:13:03
10 million versions of this I I don't know if we could afford the operations that's
1:13:08
I agree with the insight of change your presentation I don't know if I agree with the application of it there
1:13:13
turning it into a toy so like giving them a little thing that they can do to the food I like that idea
1:13:20
that I like as well again it's like it could be a durable it's to your point of like how do you make it a consumable so
1:13:26
it's an annuity so people keep buying See, he's in the cheese, but he's a competitor now. So, he doesn't like this
1:13:31
idea because he's like all about his like artisal cheese. This is
1:13:37
I'm going to do this. Baby, his cheese comes with a little stamper and he's like, "Yeah, the haters
1:13:44
said it wasn't scalable." Um, dude, Sean just pitched uh uh craft
1:13:50
singles that come with a cookie cutter. Exactly. I think you over complicated it. I think
1:14:00
The story is key to the understanding of the idea. In fact, the label is going to include the entire story that I said in,
1:14:06
you know, verbatim in size eight font. And instead of buying the chicken to support the chicken, you know, or like
1:14:12
the good a good farm, we're going to be supporting Shawn to stick it to his mother-in-law. What happened to the safe space where there's no bad ideas? You're like, watch
1:14:18
what I do if you bring a weak wimpy idea in here. I'm going to give it a wedgie.
1:14:25
So, I want to leave you with a big picture question. You've you've obviously done it. You've proven yourself, so that's good. You've made
Commit and then figure out
1:14:31
money doing what you have. You know, you're financially, you know, secure and free and all that. What is like the end
1:14:36
of the story for you? Like what are you trying to do? Do you have somebody in mind, a hero, you're like, "Oh, I kind of want to be like them." Do you think
1:14:42
like 30 years down the road like I want to have done XYZ? Do you not think about that at all? Like how do you think about
1:14:49
your life? Because like you could just keep doing this. Sounds fun. Uh is there a big picture?
1:14:54
Yeah. No, I'm I'm a planner, so there definitely is a big a big picture for me. I at the heart of it, I love
1:15:00
building and creating. And if I wasn't doing that, I think I'd be really miserable. But what I don't want to do
1:15:08
anymore is um you know, be a CEO. Were you the CEO before?
1:15:14
I've been CEO of my previous companies. Yes. And I love like being in it with a team and building it every day uh and in
1:15:21
the trenches with your team and helping steer the ship. like I I absolutely love
1:15:26
that as well, but I'm at the stage in my career that, you know, the pressures of raising capital and being able to answer
1:15:32
to that capital. I want to be able to work, you know, going back to projects, work across more things. So, I'm splitting my time between, you know,
1:15:38
continuing to incubate new ideas, but then I hire CEO and team and I work alongside that team and then moving over
1:15:44
to joining Greycraft to to launch this consumer brands fund. Really now being able to, you know, be more of a coach
1:15:51
and and help work with entrepreneurs. We we've had a bunch of people come on here with that um the the the the dream to
1:15:58
have your cake and eat it too. It's like I want to be part of the idea and like the start, but then like the grind for
1:16:03
10 years like I really want an operator to do that part. And some people have come on here and told us how they do that. Well, other people have been like
1:16:08
I don't know how to I can't incept my idea and my energy into somebody else. That's a really hard transfer to do do.
1:16:14
Do you have like a talent strate like how do you in how do you get the CEO to then like run your thing? Do you have a
1:16:20
strategy around that or is it It's hard and that's what I've been doing. I've been doing more of an incubator model my last few startups
1:16:26
where I've not been the CEO running it but actually, you know, create the team. Um, so really what I love doing is like
1:16:31
create the concept, pull together the team and the capital. But the part of that that has been really hard is
1:16:37
actually finding those leaders. And you know the reality of being an entrepreneur, it's iterative, right? You
1:16:42
try something, it work, it works or it doesn't work. you you're constantly iterating your way to success in those
1:16:48
early years, which means you're running up against roadblocks and things that worked and what didn't work. And what I
1:16:53
found is there's a certain personality that can live in that uncertainty of a startup and stay committed to it. So
1:17:00
when something doesn't work, instead of panicking, they quickly start taking the clues, figuring out, making adjustments,
1:17:05
keeping the team confident, bringing along with them. that that's the art of entrepreneurship that is really really
1:17:10
tough to hire for because the ones who are good at it want to create they probably have their own idea that they're working on and what I found is I
1:17:17
would hire very accomplished people but their entire life had been fairly linear in their careers where like I you know I
1:17:23
get good grades it unlocks getting in this good college I do really well at school it unlocks getting the right in
1:17:28
like each thing unlocks the next step for them and that's always work because they're incredibly smart talented people
1:17:34
but that's not the reality in entrepreneurship and so what I saw a pattern of like I would hire these incredibly accomplished CEOs and then as
1:17:41
soon as things would start going wrong, which they always do in a startup, they would really struggle through the mental
1:17:48
games of that. That's the hardest part of this model. You're amazing. You know, every once in
1:17:54
a while we have episodes and we're like, we have to have a part two and sometimes a part three and a part four. And hopefully that will be the case with
1:17:59
you. No, let's do it. I would love to. And I feel the same. I'm walking away on Monday morning here with more energy.
1:18:05
Um, so I really appreciate and this has been such a fun conversation and if anybody loves our ideas out there and
1:18:11
wants to pursue it, please uh please reach out where the eric ry.com and then there's like a contact button. Is that right?
1:18:18
Yeah, you could go to uh um gobstop.com gob sop.com.
1:18:24
It's for this idea that I try to build these everlasting gobstoppers and brands that continue to be able to refresh
1:18:31
themselves and stay on trend and like you try to bake that into the into the center when you create something new.
1:18:36
Oh, you're a ridiculous human being. You're awesome. Like you have like silly crazy ideas and
1:18:44
yet you've been able to make potentially hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars off it. I mean that's the dream. So thank you so much. You're the best.
1:18:50
Uh you guys are great. Thanks for a lovely conversation. [Music]
