# Story 2.4: Stages 1-3 Integration Testing and Refinement

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** pipeline developer,
**I want** integration testing across all 3 document processing stages with prompt refinement,
**so that** the offline pipeline produces high-quality universal insights consistently.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration test script created: `test_stages_1_3.py` that runs full Stage 1-3 pipeline on all 5 inputs
2. Test execution generates 5 sets of outputs (one per input) in `data/test-outputs/integration-test-stages-1-3/`
3. Quality checklist created for manual review (`docs/stage-1-3-quality-checklist.md`):
   - Stage 1: Are inspirations specific and actionable?
   - Stage 2: Are trends derived from document (not hallucinated)?
   - Stage 3: Are lessons truly universal (de-contextualized)?
4. Manual quality review completed on all 5 outputs using checklist
5. Prompt refinements implemented based on quality review findings
6. Re-run integration test after prompt refinement, verify quality improvements
7. Documentation updated: Each stage's PromptTemplate documented with rationale for key instructions
8. Success metric: 4 out of 5 inputs produce "good quality" outputs (pass quality checklist)

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 2 - Document Processing Pipeline (Stages 1-3)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.1 (Stage 1 - Input Processing)
- Story 2.2 (Stage 2 - Trend Extraction)
- Story 2.3 (Stage 3 - General Translation)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Integration testing validates end-to-end Stages 1-3 flow
- Quality checklist is manual review tool (no automation for MVP)
- Iterative prompt refinement expected
- Success threshold: 80% quality (4 out of 5 inputs)

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Integration testing is critical validation point before Stage 4 development
- Manual quality review ensures output meets requirements
- Prompt refinement is iterative process
- Documentation preserves design rationale for future improvements

**Quality Standards:**
- Stage 1: Specific, actionable inspirations (not vague observations)
- Stage 2: Document-derived trends (verifiable from source, not hallucinated)
- Stage 3: Universal lessons (truly applicable across industries)

### Testing
**Test file location:** Root directory (`test_stages_1_3.py`)
**Test standards:** Manual quality review with checklist
**Testing frameworks:** LangChain, manual quality review
**Specific requirements:**
- Run on all 5 test inputs
- Generate outputs for each input
- Manual review using quality checklist
- Achieve 80% success rate (4 out of 5 pass)
- Document prompt refinement iterations
