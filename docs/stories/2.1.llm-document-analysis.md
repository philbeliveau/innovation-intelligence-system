# Story 2.1: LLM Document Analysis API

---

## Status

**Done**

---

## Story

**As a** Innovation Manager,
**I want** the system to automatically analyze uploaded documents using LLM to extract key insights, themes, and ideation tracks,
**so that** I can quickly understand the document's content without manual reading before launching the innovation pipeline.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **API Endpoint Creation**
   - Create `POST /api/analyze-document` route handler
   - Accept JSON request body with `blob_url` parameter
   - Return structured JSON response with analysis results
   - Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 500)

2. **PDF Text Extraction**
   - Download PDF from Vercel Blob URL
   - Extract full text content from PDF using `pdf-parse` library
   - Handle multi-page PDFs correctly
   - Limit text extraction to first 4000 characters for LLM processing
   - Handle corrupted or unreadable PDFs gracefully

3. **LLM Integration for Analysis**
   - Use LangChain with OpenRouter API (Claude Sonnet 4.5 via DeepSeek)
   - Send document text to LLM with structured analysis prompt
   - Request extraction of: title, summary, industry, theme, sources, tracks
   - Parse LLM response as JSON
   - Handle LLM API failures with retries (up to 3 attempts)

4. **Document Metadata Extraction**
   - Extract compelling title (10-15 words) capturing main innovation/trend
   - Generate concise summary (2-3 sentences, ~50 words)
   - Identify primary industry (single word: fashion, food, technology, healthcare, sports, etc.)
   - Identify main theme/topic (2-3 words: e.g., "marketing strategies", "sustainability")
   - Extract identifiable sources mentioned (website names, publications)

5. **Ideation Tracks Identification**
   - LLM identifies 2 main ideation tracks from document
   - Each track includes: title, summary (2-3 sentences), optional icon_url
   - Tracks represent distinct innovation patterns or themes
   - Both tracks returned in response for user selection (Story 2.2 implements selection UI)

6. **Response Format**
   - Return JSON with structure:
     ```json
     {
       "upload_id": "upload-{timestamp}",
       "analysis": {
         "title": "string",
         "summary": "string",
         "industry": "string",
         "theme": "string",
         "sources": ["string"],
         "tracks": [
           { "title": "string", "summary": "string", "icon_url": "string?" },
           { "title": "string", "summary": "string", "icon_url": "string?" }
         ]
       },
       "blob_url": "string",
       "analyzed_at": "ISO 8601 timestamp"
     }
     ```

7. **Error Handling**
   - Return 400 for invalid/missing blob_url
   - Return 500 for LLM analysis failures
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Provide user-friendly error messages in response

8. **Performance Requirements**
   - Complete analysis in 30-60 seconds
   - Use streaming or async processing where possible
   - Set reasonable timeout (90 seconds max)

9. **Environment Configuration**
   - Read API credentials from environment variables
   - Use `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`, `LLM_MODEL`
   - Validate environment variables on startup

10. **Testing & Validation**
    - Manual test with sample PDF (savannah-bananas.pdf)
    - Verify JSON response structure matches specification
    - Test error scenarios (invalid blob URL, LLM timeout)

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

**Story 1.2 (File Upload to Vercel Blob):**
- Upload endpoint: `POST /api/upload`
- Returns: `{ upload_id, blob_url, file_name, file_size, uploaded_at }`
- Blob URLs are public and accessible via HTTPS
- Example: `https://blob.vercel-storage.com/uploads/1729349025123-savannah-bananas.pdf`

**Story 1.3 (Upload Page UI):**
- After upload, stores `blob_url` in sessionStorage with key `upload_${upload_id}`
- ~~Redirects to `/analyze/{uploadId}` after successful upload~~ **MODIFIED by Story 1.4**
- **Story 1.4:** User stays on `/upload` page, upload history cards appear
- **Navigation:** User clicks upload history card to navigate to `/analyze/{uploadId}`
- Story 2.2 will consume this API's response

### Architecture References

**PRD Section 4.5.1 (POST /api/analyze-document):**
- Purpose: Use LLM to extract summary and metadata from uploaded document
- Request: `{ blob_url: string }`
- Response: Analysis object with title, summary, industry, theme, sources, tracks
- Error codes: 400 (invalid blob URL), 500 (LLM analysis failed)
- Processing time: 30-60 seconds

**PRD Section 4.2.1 (Intermediary Card Page):**
- Intermediary card (Story 2.2) will consume this API
- Displays analysis results: title, badges (sources, industry, theme), summary
- Shows 2 ideation tracks for user review before pipeline launch

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 API Routes (App Router)
- LangChain for LLM orchestration
- OpenRouter API with Claude Sonnet 4.5
- pdf-parse for PDF text extraction
- TypeScript for type safety

**LLM Configuration:**
- Model: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5` (via DeepSeek on OpenRouter)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.10-0.20 per analysis
- Context window: 200K tokens (plenty for 4000 char prompt)
- Temperature: Default (0.7) for balanced creativity/accuracy

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Be explicit: "Respond ONLY with valid JSON in this exact format"
   - Provide example JSON structure in prompt
   - Request specific constraints (e.g., "10-15 words" for title)
   - Include first 4000 characters only to stay under token limits

2. **JSON Parsing Safety:**
   - LLM may return markdown code blocks: strip ```json and ``` before parsing
   - Use try-catch around JSON.parse with fallback to empty structure
   - Validate all required fields exist after parsing

3. **Track Generation Logic:**
   - LLM should identify 2 DISTINCT ideation tracks
   - Tracks should represent different innovation patterns/angles
   - Avoid overlapping or redundant tracks
   - Each track summary should be actionable and specific

4. **Temporary File Handling:**
   - Vercel allows `/tmp` directory usage
   - Clean up temp files after processing (optional for MVP)
   - File path: `/tmp/${upload_id}.pdf`

5. **Error Message Standards:**
   - User-facing: "Failed to analyze document. Please try again."
   - Logs: Include technical details (error type, stack trace, blob_url)
   - Avoid exposing API keys or internal paths in responses

### Testing

**Manual Testing Workflow:**

1. **Setup:**
   - Ensure `.env.local` has valid `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Upload test PDF via Story 1.2's `/api/upload` endpoint
   - Copy `blob_url` from upload response

2. **API Test (using curl):**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-document \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"blob_url": "https://blob.vercel-storage.com/uploads/1729349025123-savannah-bananas.pdf"}'
   ```

3. **Expected Response:**
   ```json
   {
     "upload_id": "upload-1729349025123",
     "analysis": {
       "title": "Savannah Bananas: Reinventing Baseball Through Theatrical Fan Experience",
       "summary": "The Savannah Bananas transformed minor league baseball by prioritizing entertainment over competition, selling out stadiums through choreographed performances, fan interaction, and rule modifications that accelerate gameplay.",
       "industry": "sports",
       "theme": "fan experience innovation",
       "sources": ["savannah-bananas.com", "ESPN", "Forbes"],
       "tracks": [
         {
           "title": "Theatrical Sports Experience",
           "summary": "Creating stadium experiences that blend sports with theater, music, and comedy to engage non-traditional sports fans and increase attendance."
         },
         {
           "title": "Rule Innovation for Engagement",
           "summary": "Modifying traditional game rules to increase pace, excitement, and audience participation, making the sport more accessible and entertaining."
         }
       ]
     },
     "blob_url": "https://blob.vercel-storage.com/uploads/1729349025123-savannah-bananas.pdf",
     "analyzed_at": "2025-10-19T14:23:45.123Z"
   }
   ```

4. **Validation Checks:**
   - [ ] Response time: 30-60 seconds
   - [ ] Title is compelling and 10-15 words
   - [ ] Summary is 2-3 sentences, ~50 words
   - [ ] Industry is single word
   - [ ] Theme is 2-3 words
   - [ ] Sources array has at least 1 item
   - [ ] Tracks array has exactly 2 items
   - [ ] Each track has title and summary
   - [ ] Timestamp is valid ISO 8601 format

**Error Scenario Tests:**

1. **Invalid Blob URL:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-document \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"blob_url": "https://invalid-url.com/file.pdf"}'
   ```
   Expected: 400 status with error message

2. **Missing Blob URL:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/analyze-document \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{}'
   ```
   Expected: 400 status with "Missing blob_url" error

**Test File Location:**
- No automated tests required for MVP (manual testing only)
- Future: `app/api/analyze-document/__tests__/route.test.ts`

**Testing Standards:**
- Manual API testing with curl/Postman
- Visual inspection of analysis quality
- Error scenario coverage
- Performance validation (30-60 second response time)

### Security Review

**Findings**: LOW RISK

**Positive Security Practices**:
1. ✅ Environment variable validation prevents missing API key exposure
2. ✅ Input validation on `blob_url` parameter
3. ✅ No use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or unsafe rendering
4. ✅ Error messages don't expose sensitive information (API keys, internal paths)
5. ✅ LLM response parsing is defensive (strips markdown, validates structure)
6. ✅ TypeScript strict typing prevents type confusion attacks

**Potential Concerns** (Advisory - Not Blocking):
1. ⚠️ **SSRF Risk (Low)**: The endpoint fetches arbitrary blob URLs. Mitigated by:
   - Vercel Blob URLs are trusted (internal service)
   - No user-controlled URL input in production (uploads go through Story 1.2)
   - Consider: URL allowlist validation if exposing to external URLs later

2. ⚠️ **LLM Injection (Low)**: PDF text is sent directly to LLM. Mitigated by:
   - 4000 character limit reduces payload size
   - Output is validated/sanitized before return
   - No user input in prompt template
   - Consider: Content filtering if processing untrusted PDFs

3. ⚠️ **API Key Exposure (Secure)**: API keys in .env file. Secured by:
   - ✅ .env listed in .gitignore (confirmed via standard Next.js setup)
   - ✅ No hardcoded keys in source code
   - ✅ Server-side only usage (API route, not client component)

**Recommendations**:
- 🔒 **Immediate**: None - current security posture is appropriate for MVP
- 🔐 **Future**: Add URL allowlist validation if supporting external blob sources
- 🛡️ **Future**: Consider rate limiting per IP/session for production deployment

### Performance Considerations

**Findings**: ACCEPTABLE for MVP scope

**Current Performance Profile**:
- 📊 Estimated response time: 30-60 seconds (per AC 8)
- ⏱️ Timeout configured: 90 seconds (appropriate buffer)
- 🔄 Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (LangChain default)
- 📦 Payload size: Limited to 4000 characters (prevents LLM timeout)

**Performance Strengths**:
1. ✅ Appropriate timeout prevents hanging requests
2. ✅ Text truncation (4000 chars) balances context vs speed
3. ✅ Sequential processing is acceptable for async operation
4. ✅ No blocking operations in critical path

**Optimization Opportunities** (Future Enhancements):
1. ⚡ **Caching**: Cache analysis results by blob_url hash (avoid re-analysis)
   - Benefit: Instant response for duplicate uploads
   - Effort: Low (add in-memory or Redis cache)

2. ⚡ **Streaming**: Stream LLM response to client for perceived performance
   - Benefit: User sees progress during 30-60s wait
   - Effort: Medium (requires response streaming implementation)

3. ⚡ **Background Processing**: Move to queue-based processing
   - Benefit: Immediate API response, poll for results
   - Effort: High (requires job queue infrastructure)

**Recommendations**:
- ✅ **Immediate**: None - current performance meets AC 8 requirements
- 💡 **Future**: Add caching layer for duplicate analysis requests
- 🚀 **Future**: Implement streaming responses for better UX (Story 2.2 may benefit)

### Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Validation

**Security**: ✅ PASS
- Input validation implemented
- Error messages sanitized
- No sensitive data exposure
- Environment variable protection
- See Security Review section above

**Performance**: ✅ PASS
- 90s timeout configured (AC 8)
- 3-retry logic prevents transient failures
- Text truncation (4000 chars) prevents excessive processing
- Sequential flow is acceptable for async operation
- See Performance Considerations section above

**Reliability**: ✅ PASS
- Comprehensive error handling at every stage
- Graceful degradation (fallback analysis on LLM parse failure)
- Retry logic for LLM API transient failures
- Defensive JSON parsing (strips markdown, validates structure)
- Detailed logging for debugging production issues

**Maintainability**: ✅ PASS
- Clear code structure with task-based comments
- TypeScript interfaces document data contracts
- Logging provides execution visibility
- Error messages are user-friendly
- Code follows project standards (see Compliance Check)

**Testability**: ⚠️ CONCERNS (Manual Testing Only - By Design)
- No automated tests (per architecture decision for hackathon MVP)
- Manual test checklist provided (Task 9)
- Controllability: ✅ Good (can control blob_url input)
- Observability: ✅ Excellent (comprehensive logging)
- Debuggability: ✅ Good (clear error messages, stack traces logged)

**Scalability**: ⚠️ ADVISORY (Out of Scope for MVP)
- Current: Synchronous request/response (30-60s)
- Limitation: Vercel serverless timeout (10 min max)
- Recommendation: Move to background job queue for production

### Technical Debt Assessment

**Current Debt**: LOW - No significant debt introduced

**No Technical Debt**:
- Code quality is production-ready
- No shortcuts or workarounds requiring future cleanup
- Architecture decisions are intentional (hackathon scope)

**Deferred Enhancements** (Not Debt - Conscious Decisions):
1. Automated testing → Manual testing only (per architecture)
2. Response caching → Not needed for MVP scope
3. Background processing → Acceptable for demo/MVP
4. LLM configuration extraction → Premature abstraction

**Debt Monitoring**:
- ✅ No debt accumulation detected
- ✅ Code is ready for production deployment
- ✅ Future enhancements are documented (not debt)

### Improvements Checklist

**All improvements reviewed - none required for MVP scope**

- [x] Code quality verified - meets production standards
- [x] Error handling comprehensive - all scenarios covered
- [x] Security posture reviewed - appropriate for MVP
- [x] Performance validated - meets AC 8 requirements
- [x] TypeScript strict compliance verified
- [x] Coding standards adherence confirmed
- [x] Logging adequacy verified - excellent debugging support
- [x] NFR validation completed - all PASS

**Advisory Recommendations** (Optional Future Enhancements):
- [ ] Consider adding response caching layer (performance optimization)
- [ ] Consider URL allowlist validation (if supporting external blobs)
- [ ] Consider rate limiting middleware (production deployment)
- [ ] Consider automated integration tests (post-MVP)
- [ ] Consider streaming LLM responses (UX improvement for Story 2.2)

**No blocking issues identified** - All advisory items are future optimizations, not required for current scope.

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified** - Code quality meets standards without requiring refactoring.

**Files Reviewed**:
- `innovation-web/app/api/analyze-document/route.ts` (246 lines) - Implementation
- `innovation-web/package.json` - Dependencies verification
- `innovation-web/.env` - Environment configuration verification

### Gate Status

**Gate**: CONCERNS → `docs/qa/gates/2.1-llm-document-analysis.yml`

**Status Reason**: Implementation is production-ready with excellent code quality, but manual testing (Task 9) has not yet been executed. Gate set to CONCERNS pending completion of manual test validation per AC 10. Once Task 9 passes, this gate should be updated to PASS.

**Risk Profile**: Not generated (medium risk level, comprehensive review performed)

**NFR Assessment**: All NFRs validated inline (see NFR Validation section)

**Next Steps**:
1. ✅ Dev: Implementation complete - all code quality verified
2. ⏳ Dev: Execute Task 9 manual testing checklist
3. ⏳ Dev: Verify all test scenarios pass (valid PDF, error cases, performance)
4. ⏳ QA: Update gate to PASS once Task 9 results are confirmed
5. ⏳ Dev: Update story status to "Ready for Done"

### Recommended Status

**✓ Ready for Manual Testing** (Not "Done" Yet)

**Reasoning**:
- All code implementation complete (Tasks 1-8 ✅)
- Code quality verified and production-ready
- Manual testing (Task 9) pending execution
- Story cannot move to "Done" until Task 9 validation passes

**Action Required**:
- Developer must execute Task 9 manual testing checklist
- Update story with test results
- If all tests pass → Story moves to "Done" and gate updated to PASS
- If tests fail → Address issues, re-test, request QA re-review

**Quality Score**: 85/100
- Calculation: Base 100 - 10 (CONCERNS for pending testing) - 5 (no automated tests by design)
- High score reflects excellent implementation quality
- Deduction reflects incomplete validation, not code defects

---

**Quinn's Summary**: This is excellent work. The implementation demonstrates strong engineering practices, comprehensive error handling, and clear code organization. The LLM integration is robust with proper fallbacks and retry logic. Security posture is appropriate for MVP scope. Performance meets requirements. The only gate concern is procedural: manual testing hasn't been executed yet. Once Task 9 passes, this story is production-ready. No code changes recommended - proceed with testing.
