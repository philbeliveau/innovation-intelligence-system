# Story 1.3: Brand Profile Creation for 4 Test Brands

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** pipeline developer,
**I want** comprehensive YAML brand profiles for Lactalis Canada, McCormick USA, Columbia Sportswear, and Decathlon,
**so that** Stage 4 can contextualize opportunities with accurate brand information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Four brand profile YAML files created in `data/brand-profiles/`:
   - `lactalis-canada.yaml`
   - `mccormick-usa.yaml`
   - `columbia-sportswear.yaml`
   - `decathlon.yaml`
2. Each profile contains minimum fields:
   - `brand_name` (string)
   - `country` (string)
   - `industry` (string)
   - `positioning` (1-2 sentence string)
   - `product_portfolio` (list of strings)
   - `target_customers` (list of strings)
   - `recent_innovations` (list of strings, 2-3 examples)
   - `strategic_priorities` (list of strings)
   - `brand_values` (list of strings)
3. Brand profile schema documented in `docs/brand-profile-schema.md` with field descriptions and examples
4. Test script (`test_brand_profiles.py`) validates YAML syntax and required fields for all 4 profiles
5. All profiles load successfully with PyYAML without errors

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Data Setup

**Dependencies:**
- Story 1.1 (Repository Structure and Python Environment Setup)

**Technical Requirements:**
- YAML format for easy parsing and human readability
- Brand profiles should be comprehensive enough for meaningful contextualization
- Research data files already exist in `docs/web-search-setup/` for reference

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure consistent field naming across all profiles
- Maintain accuracy and relevance of brand information
- Validate YAML structure before committing

**Reference Data:**
- Existing research files in `docs/web-search-setup/` directory

### Testing
**Test file location:** Root directory (`test_brand_profiles.py`)
**Test standards:** Validate YAML syntax and required fields
**Testing frameworks:** PyYAML
**Specific requirements:**
- All 4 profiles must load without YAML syntax errors
- All required fields must be present in each profile
- Field types must match schema specifications
