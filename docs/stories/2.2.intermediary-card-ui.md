# Story 2.2: Intermediary Card UI with Track Display

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** Innovation Manager,
**I want** to view a visually compelling intermediary card showing the analyzed document summary and ideation tracks after clicking an upload history card (Story 1.4),
**so that** I can review the LLM's understanding before launching the full pipeline.

**Navigation Context (Story 1.4):** User uploads file → stays on `/upload` page → clicks upload history card → navigates to this page (`/analyze/{uploadId}`).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Intermediary Card Display**
   - Create `/app/analyze/[uploadId]/page.tsx` route with dynamic parameter
   - Display loading state with spinner and "Analyzing document..." message during LLM processing (30-60 seconds)
   - Render document analysis data in card layout matching reference design (`docs/image/intermediary-card.png`)

2. **Left Card - Document Summary Section**
   - Display LLM-generated title (10-15 words, prominent heading)
   - Show hero image placeholder (gradient or generic image)
   - Render source badges as dark gray pills
   - Show industry badge as orange pill
   - Show theme badge as red pill
   - Display 2-3 sentence summary (~50 words)
   - Include 3-dot pagination indicator at bottom

3. **Right Section - Ideation Tracks Display**
   - Display 2 ideation tracks side-by-side (matching `docs/image/track-division.png` UI)
   - Each track shows: radio button/checkbox selector, icon placeholder, title, 2-3 sentence summary
   - User must select exactly 1 track (radio button interaction)
   - Selected track displays with highlighted border/background
   - Non-selected track displays with dimmed/gray appearance
   - Default: Track 1 pre-selected on page load

4. **Launch Action**
   - Center-aligned "Launch" button below track cards
   - On click: POST to `/api/run` with `blob_url`, `upload_id`, and `selected_tracks: [selectedTrackNumber]` (array with single track ID: [1] or [2])
   - Show loading spinner on button during API call
   - Transition animation: selected track stays in main content area, non-selected track animates to left sidebar
   - Redirect to `/pipeline/{runId}` on successful API response, passing selected track state

5. **API Integration with Story 2.1**
   - Retrieve `blob_url` from `sessionStorage` using `upload_${uploadId}` key (set in Story 1.2)
   - Call `/api/analyze-document` endpoint on page load
   - Parse response containing: `{ analysis: { title, summary, industry, theme, sources, tracks } }`

6. **Navigation Flow Continuity**
   - Maintain company context from cookie throughout flow
   - Pass `blob_url` and `upload_id` to `/api/run` endpoint
   - Preserve run state for pipeline viewer handoff

7. **Error Handling**
   - Display user-friendly error if analysis API fails
   - Show "Try Again" button to retry analysis
   - Redirect to homepage if `blob_url` not found in session

8. **UI/UX Standards**
   - Visual fidelity to reference designs: 90%+ match to `docs/image/intermediary-card.png`
   - Responsive layout using Tailwind responsive classes (desktop-first for MVP)
   - Accessible button states (disabled, loading, default)
   - Smooth loading transitions with skeleton states

9. **Code Quality**
   - TypeScript strict mode with proper typing
   - Client component with `'use client'` directive
   - Proper error boundaries for API failures
   - Clean separation of UI components

10. **Testing Coverage**
    - Manual test: Upload file → verify card displays correctly with Track 1 pre-selected
    - Manual test: Toggle track selection → verify visual feedback (highlight/dim)
    - Manual test: Select Track 2 → verify only Track 2 highlighted
    - Manual test: Click Launch with Track 1 selected → verify correct track ID passed to API
    - Manual test: Click Launch with Track 2 selected → verify correct track ID passed to API
    - Manual test: Verify selected track stays in main area, non-selected moves to sidebar
    - Manual test: Refresh page → verify graceful error handling

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

**Story 1.2 (File Upload to Vercel Blob):**
- Upload endpoint returns: `{ upload_id, blob_url, file_name, file_size, uploaded_at }`
- `blob_url` is stored in `sessionStorage` with key `upload_${upload_id}` by Story 1.3
- Session storage set in Story 1.3's upload handler after successful API response

**Story 1.4 (Upload History Display):**
- User stays on `/upload` page after successful upload (no automatic redirect)
- Upload history cards appear below upload zone
- User navigates to this page by clicking an upload history card
- Card click triggers: `router.push(\`/analyze/${uploadId}\`)`

**Story 2.1 (LLM Document Analysis API):**
- API endpoint: `POST /api/analyze-document`
- Request body: `{ blob_url: string }`
- Response format:
  ```typescript
  {
    upload_id: string,
    analysis: {
      title: string,         // "Ad-generating QR codes incorporated into..."
      summary: string,       // "Most people only wear a fraction..."
      industry: string,      // "fashion"
      theme: string,         // "marketing strategies"
      sources: string[],     // ["trendwatching.com", "8 others"]
      tracks: Array<{
        title: string,
        summary: string,
        icon_url?: string
      }>
    },
    blob_url: string,
    analyzed_at: string
  }
  ```
- Processing time: 30-60 seconds (LLM extraction)

### Architecture References

**PRD Section 4.2 (Intermediary Card Page):**
- Visual reference: `docs/image/intermediary-card.png`, `docs/image/track-division.png`
- Layout: Left card (document summary) + Right section (2 tracks side-by-side)
- Navigation flow: Upload → Analyze → Pipeline Viewer
- Launch action triggers pipeline execution via `/api/run` endpoint

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 App Router with React Server Components
- TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Client-side data fetching with `fetch()` API

**Component Patterns:**
- Use `'use client'` directive for interactive components
- Implement loading states with shadcn/ui Skeleton
- Error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Styling Conventions:**
- Badge colors: Sources (secondary/gray), Industry (orange-500), Theme (red-600)
- Card padding: `p-6` with `mb-6` spacing
- Button sizing: `size="lg"` for primary actions
- Responsive classes: Desktop-first with basic mobile support

### Important Implementation Notes

1. **Session Storage Key Format:** `upload_${uploadId}` (must match Story 1.3's storage pattern)
2. **Track Selection Logic:** User must select exactly 1 track via radio button (default: Track 1)
3. **Selected Track State:** Store selected track ID in sessionStorage for pipeline viewer: `sessionStorage.setItem('selected_track', selectedTrack)`
4. **Non-Selected Track Storage:** Store non-selected track data in sessionStorage for sidebar display: `sessionStorage.setItem('non_selected_track', JSON.stringify(trackData))`
5. **API Request:** Send only selected track: `selected_tracks: [selectedTrack]` (array with single ID)
6. **Hero Image:** Use gradient only - no actual image upload/display in MVP
7. **API Error Handling:** Display user-friendly messages, avoid technical jargon
8. **Loading Spinner:** Use shadcn/ui Button's loading state (built-in spinner support)
9. **Navigation:** Use Next.js `useRouter()` from `next/navigation` (App Router, not Pages Router)

### Testing

**Manual Testing Checklist:**

1. **Happy Path Test (Story 1.4 Flow):**
   - Upload PDF file via Story 1.3
   - ~~Verify redirect to `/analyze/{uploadId}`~~ Verify user stays on `/upload` page (Story 1.4)
   - Verify upload history card appears
   - Click upload history card → navigate to `/analyze/{uploadId}`
   - Wait 30-60 seconds for LLM analysis
   - Verify all UI elements render correctly
   - Click "Launch" button
   - Verify redirect to `/pipeline/{runId}`

2. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test missing blob URL: Clear sessionStorage → verify error message + retry option
   - Test API failure: Mock 500 error → verify graceful error handling
   - Test network timeout: Slow connection → verify loading state persists

3. **UI Validation:**
   - Verify badge colors match specification (gray, orange, red)
   - Verify track cards display side-by-side
   - Verify checkmarks appear on both tracks
   - Verify button states: default, loading, disabled
   - Compare UI to reference images at 90%+ similarity

**Test File Location:**
- No automated tests required for MVP (manual testing only)
- Future: `app/analyze/[uploadId]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards:**
- Manual testing during development
- Visual comparison with reference designs
- Error scenario coverage (missing data, API failures)
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Safari, Firefox - latest versions)
