# Story 1.1: Repository Structure and Python Environment Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a clean repository structure with Python virtual environment and all LangChain dependencies installed,
**so that** I can immediately start building pipeline stages without configuration overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Directory structure created matching Technical Assumptions spec (`/pipeline/`, `/data/`, `/templates/`, `run_pipeline.py`, etc.)
2. Python 3.10+ virtual environment created with `requirements.txt` containing: `langchain`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-community`, `openai`, `pypdf`, `pyyaml`, `jinja2`
3. `.env.template` file created documenting required environment variables (OPENROUTER_API_KEY, OPENROUTER_BASE_URL)
4. `.gitignore` configured to exclude virtual environment, `.env`, and test output files
5. Basic `README.md` created with setup instructions and quick-start commands
6. Successful test: `python -c "import langchain; from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI; print('Environment ready')"` executes without errors

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create directory structure (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `/pipeline/` directory with subdirectories for stages and prompts
  - [x] Create `/data/` directory for input and output
  - [x] Create `/templates/` directory for document templates

- [x] Set up Python virtual environment (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create virtual environment using Python 3.10+
  - [x] Create `requirements.txt` with all required dependencies
  - [x] Install all dependencies in virtual environment
- [x] Configure environment and documentation (AC: 3, 4, 5)
  - [x] Create `.env.template` with OPENROUTER_API_KEY and OPENROUTER_BASE_URL
  - [x] Update `.gitignore` to exclude data/test-outputs/
  - [x] Update `README.md` with setup instructions and quick-start commands
- [x] Verify environment setup (AC: 6)
  - [x] Run import test command
  - [x] Verify all imports work correctly

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Foundation & Data Setup

**Dependencies:**
- None (foundational story)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Python 3.10+ required
- Virtual environment should be in `venv/` or `.venv/`
- OpenRouter API key will be needed for LLM access

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Ensure all directory paths follow the Technical Assumptions specification
- Virtual environment should be easily activatable with standard commands
- Environment template should clearly document all required variables

### Testing
**Test file location:** Root directory test execution
**Test standards:** Import verification test
**Testing frameworks:** Built-in Python imports
**Specific requirements:** Verify `python -c "import langchain; from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI; print('Environment ready')"` runs without errors

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent implementation quality with comprehensive attention to detail. All acceptance criteria met with high standards. The foundation has been properly established for subsequent pipeline development.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clean, well-organized directory structure matching architectural specifications exactly
- Python 3.13.7 exceeds minimum requirement (3.10+)
- Comprehensive requirements.txt with appropriate version constraints
- Excellent README.md documentation with clear Quick Start section
- Proper .gitignore configuration with comprehensive exclusions
- Successful import verification test

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: run_pipeline.py:13
  - **Change**: Added `-> None` return type hint to `main()` function
  - **Why**: Coding standards require type hints for all function signatures (coding-standards.md line 40-58)
  - **How**: Ensures complete type safety and improves code maintainability for AI agents and developers

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **PASS** - Follows PEP 8, proper logging, docstrings present, type hints complete
- Project Structure: ✓ **PASS** - Matches 7-file-structure.md specification exactly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **PASS** - Import verification test executed successfully
- All ACs Met: ✓ **PASS** - All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

1. ✓ **AC1 - Directory Structure**: All required directories created (`pipeline/`, `data/`, `templates/`, subdirectories)
2. ✓ **AC2 - Python Environment**: Python 3.13.7 virtual environment with all required dependencies installed
3. ✓ **AC3 - Environment Template**: `.env.template` created with clear documentation and helpful URLs
4. ✓ **AC4 - .gitignore Configuration**: Properly excludes venv/, .env, and data/test-outputs/
5. ✓ **AC5 - README.md**: Comprehensive Quick Start section with setup instructions and directory structure
6. ✓ **AC6 - Import Test**: Successfully verified with `python -c "import langchain; from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI; print('Environment ready')"`

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added missing return type hint to main() function (run_pipeline.py:13)
- [x] Verified all directory structure matches architectural specifications
- [x] Verified all dependencies installed and import test passes
- [x] Confirmed .gitignore excludes all sensitive/generated files
- [x] Validated README.md provides clear setup instructions

### Security Review

**Status**: ✓ **PASS**

- No hardcoded API keys or secrets in codebase
- `.env` file properly excluded from git
- `.env.template` provides clear documentation for required environment variables
- API key documentation includes helpful URL for obtaining credentials
- Comprehensive .gitignore excludes sensitive data directories

### Performance Considerations

**Status**: ✓ **PASS**

- Python 3.13.7 exceeds minimum 3.10+ requirement, providing latest performance optimizations
- Dependencies use appropriate version constraints (>=) allowing for updates
- Virtual environment properly isolated from system Python
- No performance concerns for foundational setup

### Reliability Assessment

**Status**: ✓ **PASS**

- Proper logging configuration structure in place
- Error handling patterns established in run_pipeline.py
- Comprehensive .gitignore prevents accidental commits of generated files
- Clear documentation reduces setup errors

### Maintainability Assessment

**Status**: ✓ **PASS**

- Clean, logical directory structure
- Comprehensive README.md with Quick Start instructions
- Well-documented requirements.txt with comments
- Follows established coding standards (PEP 8)
- Self-documenting code with proper docstrings

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA**:
- run_pipeline.py (added return type hint to main() function)

**Note**: Developer should acknowledge this minor enhancement in File List if updating the story.

### Gate Status

**Gate**: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1-repository-structure-python-environment-setup.yml

**Quality Score**: 100/100

**Risk Profile**: Low risk - foundational setup with no critical concerns

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, coding standards satisfied, no blocking issues.

### Additional Recommendations (Future Enhancements)

Non-blocking suggestions for future consideration:
- Consider adding pre-commit hooks for automatic code formatting (Black, flake8)
- Consider adding a Makefile for common development tasks (setup, test, clean)
- Consider adding pytest configuration for when unit tests are added in future stories
