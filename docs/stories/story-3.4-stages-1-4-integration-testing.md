# Story 3.4: Complete Pipeline (Stages 1-4) Integration Testing

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** pipeline developer,
**I want** full Stages 1-4 pipeline tested on multiple input/brand combinations,
**so that** the end-to-end flow is validated before building Stage 5.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Integration test runs 8 scenarios:
   - Savannah Bananas → All 4 brands
   - Premium Fast Food → All 4 brands
2. Test execution time measured per scenario (target: <30 minutes)
3. All 8 scenarios complete successfully with no fatal errors
4. Output quality spot-check: Manual review of 2 randomly selected outputs confirms:
   - Stage 1 inspirations are relevant
   - Stage 2 trends are document-derived
   - Stage 3 lessons are universal
   - Stage 4 insights are brand-specific
5. Error handling validation: Intentionally remove research file for one run, verify pipeline completes with degraded output and logged warning
6. Documentation: `docs/pipeline-execution-guide.md` created with troubleshooting tips based on integration testing findings
7. Performance baseline established: Average execution time per scenario documented

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 3 - Brand Contextualization with Research Data (Stage 4)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.2 (Stage 4 - Brand Contextualization Chain)
- Story 3.3 (Multi-Brand Differentiation Testing)

**Technical Requirements:**
- 8 scenarios = 2 inputs × 4 brands
- Performance target: <30 minutes per scenario
- Validates end-to-end pipeline before Stage 5
- Error handling must be robust for missing research data

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Final validation before Stage 5 development
- Performance baseline critical for future optimization
- Error handling validation ensures production readiness
- Documentation captures tribal knowledge from testing

**Performance Considerations:**
- Target: <30 minutes per scenario
- Monitor LLM API response times
- Track file I/O performance
- Identify optimization opportunities

### Testing
**Test file location:** Integration test script and execution guide
**Test standards:** End-to-end validation with quality spot-checks
**Testing frameworks:** LangChain, manual quality review
**Specific requirements:**
- Run 8 complete scenarios (2 inputs × 4 brands)
- Measure execution time per scenario (<30 min target)
- No fatal errors allowed
- Spot-check 2 random outputs for quality
- Validate error handling with missing research file
- Document performance baseline
