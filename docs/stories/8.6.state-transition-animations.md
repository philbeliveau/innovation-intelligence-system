# Story 8.6: State Transition Animations

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Pipeline Visualization Refactor
**Priority:** P2
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** CPG Innovation Manager using the Innovation Intelligence Pipeline,
**I want** smooth, visually polished transitions between the 4 progressive UI states,
**so that** the pipeline evolution feels natural and professional rather than jarring or disruptive.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. State Transition Timings Defined
- State 1 → State 2: 600ms fade transition
- State 2 → State 3: 800ms slide-up + fade transition
- State 3 → State 4: 400ms sidebar collapse + detail expand
- State 4 → State 3: 400ms reverse transition (collapse detail, expand grid)
- All transitions use `ease-in-out` timing function
- Transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

### 2. GPU-Accelerated Animations Only
- Animations use `transform` and `opacity` properties only (no layout-triggering properties)
- No animations on `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`, `margin`, `padding`
- All animated elements use `will-change: transform, opacity` sparingly
- `will-change` removed after animation completes
- No janky frame drops on 60Hz displays

### 3. Fade Transitions for Content Swaps
- Outgoing state: Opacity 1 → 0 (first half of transition)
- Incoming state: Opacity 0 → 1 (second half of transition)
- Content swap occurs at 50% mark (when old content fully faded)
- Z-index stacking prevents flickering during crossfade
- Loading states show skeleton screens during data fetch

### 4. Slide Transitions for Stage Progression
- State 2 → State 3: Content slides up 20px while fading in
- Implemented via `transform: translateY(20px)` → `translateY(0)`
- Combined with opacity 0 → 1
- Stagger effect: Cards appear sequentially (100ms delay per card)
- Maximum 6 cards stagger, then batch remaining

### 5. Sidebar Collapse Animation (State 3 → State 4)
- Collapsed sidebar width: 120px (thumbnail strip)
- Expanded grid width: Full width minus 120px
- Transition: `transform: translateX(-80%)` for sidebar collapse
- Detail panel: `transform: translateX(120px)` → `translateX(0)` + fade in
- Thumbnail cards: Shrink + darken during collapse (200ms)
- Selected card: Highlight with teal border (2px solid #5B9A99)

### 6. Reduced Motion Fallback
- Detect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` media query
- When active: Instant state changes (no animations)
- Alternative feedback: Brief color pulse (teal background flash, 150ms)
- Focus management: Move keyboard focus to new primary content
- Announce state changes to screen readers via `aria-live="polite"`

### 7. Performance Monitoring
- All transitions maintain 60fps (16.67ms per frame)
- Use `requestAnimationFrame` for JavaScript-driven animations
- Monitor with Chrome DevTools Performance panel during QA
- No layout thrashing (avoid reading layout properties during animation)
- Measure Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1

// lib/transitions.ts
export const TRANSITIONS = {
  STATE_1_TO_2: {
    duration: 600,
    easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)',
    type: 'fade'
  },
  STATE_2_TO_3: {
    duration: 800,

    duration: 400,
    easing: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)',
    type: 'sidebar-expand'
  }
} as const
```

**GPU-Accelerated Animation Utility:**
```typescript
// hooks/useWillChange.ts
import { useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export const useWillChange = (isAnimating: boolean) => {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLElement>(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const el = ref.current
    if (!el) return

    if (isAnimating) {
      el.style.willChange = 'transform, opacity'
    } else {
      // Remove after animation completes
      const timeout = setTimeout(() => {
        el.style.willChange = 'auto'
      }, 50)
      return () => clearTimeout(timeout)
    }
  }, [isAnimating])

  return ref
}
```

**Reduced Motion Hook:**
```typescript
// hooks/useReducedMotion.ts
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export const useReducedMotion = () => {
  const [prefersReducedMotion, setPrefersReducedMotion] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    const mediaQuery = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)')
    setPrefersReducedMotion(mediaQuery.matches)

    const handleChange = (e: MediaQueryListEvent) => {
      setPrefersReducedMotion(e.matches)
    }

    mediaQuery.addEventListener('change', handleChange)
    return () => mediaQuery.removeEventListener('change', handleChange)
  }, [])

  return prefersReducedMotion
}
```

**FadeTransition Component:**
```typescript
// components/animations/FadeTransition.tsx
import { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { useReducedMotion } from '@/hooks/useReducedMotion'

interface FadeTransitionProps {
  isVisible: boolean
  duration?: number
  children: ReactNode
  onTransitionEnd?: () => void
}

export const FadeTransition = ({
  isVisible,
  duration = 600,
  children,
  onTransitionEnd
}: FadeTransitionProps) => {
  const reducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
  const actualDuration = reducedMotion ? 0 : duration

  return (
    <div
      className="transition-opacity"
      style={{
        opacity: isVisible ? 1 : 0,
        transitionDuration: `${actualDuration}ms`,
        transitionTimingFunction: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)'
      }}
      onTransitionEnd={onTransitionEnd}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**SlideUpTransition Component:**
```typescript
// components/animations/SlideUpTransition.tsx
import { ReactNode } from 'react'
import { useReducedMotion } from '@/hooks/useReducedMotion'
import { useWillChange } from '@/hooks/useWillChange'

interface SlideUpTransitionProps {
  isVisible: boolean
  duration?: number
  staggerDelay?: number
  index?: number
  children: ReactNode
}

export const SlideUpTransition = ({
  isVisible,
  duration = 800,
  staggerDelay = 100,
  index = 0,
  children
}: SlideUpTransitionProps) => {
  const reducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
  const ref = useWillChange(isVisible)

  const actualDuration = reducedMotion ? 0 : duration
  const delay = reducedMotion ? 0 : Math.min(index * staggerDelay, 600)

  return (
    <div
      ref={ref as any}
      className="transition-all"
      style={{
        opacity: isVisible ? 1 : 0,
        transform: isVisible ? 'translateY(0)' : 'translateY(20px)',
        transitionDuration: `${actualDuration}ms`,
        transitionDelay: `${delay}ms`,
        transitionTimingFunction: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)'
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Sidebar Collapse Animation:**
```typescript
// In CollapsedSidebar.tsx
const sidebarVariants = {
  expanded: {
    width: '100%',
    transform: 'translateX(0)',
    transition: { duration: 0.4, ease: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1] }
  },
  collapsed: {
    width: '120px',
    transform: 'translateX(0)',
    transition: { duration: 0.4, ease: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1] }
  }
}

// Usage
<motion.div
  variants={sidebarVariants}
  animate={isState4 ? 'collapsed' : 'expanded'}
>
  {thumbnails}
</motion.div>
```

**Reduced Motion Fallback:**
```typescript
// Alternative color pulse for reduced motion
const ColorPulse = () => {
  const [isPulsing, setIsPulsing] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsPulsing(true)
    const timeout = setTimeout(() => setIsPulsing(false), 150)
    return () => clearTimeout(timeout)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div
      className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none"
      style={{
        backgroundColor: isPulsing ? 'rgba(91, 154, 153, 0.1)' : 'transparent',
        transition: 'background-color 150ms'
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

#### Specific Testing Requirements

**Test: State Transition Timing**
```typescript
test('State 1 to 2 transition completes in 600ms', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<PipelineStateMachine currentStage={1} status="PROCESSING" />)

  const startTime = performance.now()

  // Trigger state change
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByTestId('trigger-state-2'))

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByTestId('state-2')).toBeVisible()
  })

  const elapsed = performance.now() - startTime
  expect(elapsed).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(550) // 600ms - 50ms tolerance
  expect(elapsed).toBeLessThanOrEqual(650) // 600ms + 50ms tolerance
})
```

**Test: GPU Acceleration**
```typescript
test('applies will-change during animation, removes after', async () => {
  const { container } = render(<FadeTransition isVisible={true} />)
  const element = container.firstChild as HTMLElement

  // During animation
  expect(element.style.willChange).toBe('transform, opacity')

  // After animation (wait for cleanup)
  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(element.style.willChange).toBe('auto')
  }, { timeout: 1000 })
})
```

**Test: Reduced Motion Fallback**
```typescript
test('disables animations when prefers-reduced-motion is set', () => {
  // Mock media query
  Object.defineProperty(window, 'matchMedia', {
    writable: true,
    value: jest.fn().mockImplementation(query => ({
      matches: query === '(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)',
      media: query,
      addEventListener: jest.fn(),
      removeEventListener: jest.fn()
    }))
  })

  const { container } = render(<SlideUpTransition isVisible={true} />)
  const element = container.firstChild as HTMLElement

  expect(element.style.transitionDuration).toBe('0ms')
})
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall: EXCELLENT with CONCERNS**

The animation implementation demonstrates exceptional quality with GPU-accelerated transitions, comprehensive accessibility support, and clean architectural patterns. The developer has created a well-structured animation system with reusable components, proper reduced motion fallbacks, and excellent documentation. The 19 passing unit tests for core animation components show solid coverage of transition logic.

However, **critical gaps exist in AC#7 (Performance Monitoring)** - the required performance testing infrastructure (`__tests__/performance/animation-fps.test.tsx`) was not created, and cross-browser E2E tests are missing. Additionally, the integration of animations into `PipelineStateMachine` has broken existing state-machine tests (3/15 passing).

**Strengths:**
- ✅ GPU-accelerated animations (transform/opacity only - no layout thrashing)
- ✅ Comprehensive reduced motion support with color pulse fallback
- ✅ Excellent accessibility (StateAnnouncer with aria-live, focus management)
- ✅ Clean, reusable component architecture
- ✅ Performance utilities created (FPS monitoring, CLS measurement)
- ✅ Well-documented code with JSDoc comments
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout

**Concerns:**
- ⚠️ Performance testing infrastructure incomplete (AC#7)
- ⚠️ State-machine tests broken by animation additions (3/15 passing)
- ⚠️ No Playwright E2E tests for cross-browser validation
- ⚠️ Pre-existing TypeScript issues in ExpandedSparkDetail remain unfixed

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring performed during this review.** The implementation quality is high and does not require immediate code changes. The issues identified are related to testing infrastructure gaps rather than code quality problems.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS
  - Proper file naming conventions (PascalCase for components, kebab-case for utilities)
  - Correct import organization (external → internal → types)
  - Appropriate use of 'use client' directive
  - Clean separation of concerns

- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS
  - Files created in correct locations (lib/, hooks/, components/animations/)
  - Follows established patterns for pipeline components
  - Proper integration with existing PipelineStateMachine

- **Testing Strategy:** ⚠️ CONCERNS
  - Unit tests excellent (19 passing tests)
  - Integration tests need updating (state-machine.test.tsx)
  - **Performance tests missing** (AC#7 requirement)
  - **E2E tests missing** (AC#7 cross-browser requirement)

- **All ACs Met:** ⚠️ PARTIAL
  - AC#1-6: ✅ Fully implemented
  - AC#7: ⚠️ Partially implemented (utilities created, but testing infrastructure missing)

### Improvements Checklist

**Completed by Developer:**
- [x] GPU-accelerated animation components (FadeTransition, SlideUpTransition)
- [x] Reduced motion detection and fallback (useReducedMotion hook)
- [x] Accessibility support (StateAnnouncer, aria-live, focus management)
- [x] Performance utilities (monitorFPS, measureCLS, useWillChange)
- [x] Integration with pipeline components (PipelineStateMachine, SparksGrid, CollapsedSidebar)
- [x] Unit test suite for animation components (19 tests passing)

**Requires Attention (Dev to Complete):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Create performance test suite (`__tests__/performance/animation-fps.test.tsx`)
  - FPS monitoring during transitions (verify 60fps maintained)
  - CLS measurement with Lighthouse integration
  - Chrome DevTools Performance panel automation
  - Test with CPU throttling (4x slowdown per AC#7)
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Fix failing state-machine tests (3/15 passing)
  - Add mocks for FadeTransition component
  - Add mocks for StateAnnouncer component
  - Update test expectations for animation wrappers
- [ ] Create Playwright E2E tests for cross-browser validation
  - Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge (per AC#7)
  - Test actual animation timing (600ms, 800ms, 400ms)
  - Verify reduced motion behavior in browsers
- [ ] Resolve pre-existing TypeScript type issues in ExpandedSparkDetail
  - react-markdown type compatibility
  - Consider upgrading react-markdown or adding type declarations

**Future Enhancements (Optional):**
- [ ] Add performance budgets to CI/CD pipeline (Lighthouse CLS < 0.1)
- [ ] Create visual regression tests for animation states (Percy/Chromatic)
- [ ] Add animation performance profiling in production (Real User Monitoring)

### Security Review

**Status: ✅ PASS**

No security concerns identified. All animations are client-side only with no data handling, API calls, or user input processing. The implementation does not introduce any attack vectors.

### Performance Considerations

**Status: ⚠️ CONCERNS**

**Excellent Implementation, Insufficient Validation:**

The animation implementation itself is performance-optimized:
- GPU-accelerated properties only (transform, opacity)
- will-change applied/removed correctly via useWillChange hook
- No layout-triggering properties used
- Stagger capped at 6 items to prevent excessive delays
- requestAnimationFrame utilities available

**However, AC#7 explicitly requires performance validation:**
> "All transitions maintain 60fps (16.67ms per frame)"
> "Use requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript-driven animations"
> "Monitor with Chrome DevTools Performance panel during QA"
> "Measure Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1"

**Missing validation infrastructure:**
- No automated performance tests created
- No Chrome DevTools Performance integration
- No CLS measurement in test suite
- No FPS verification tests
- No CPU throttling tests

**Recommendation:** The utilities exist (monitorFPS, measureCLS) but are not integrated into automated tests. Create `__tests__/performance/animation-fps.test.tsx` before marking story as Done.

### Accessibility Review

**Status: ✅ EXCELLENT**

Comprehensive accessibility support implemented:

- ✅ **Reduced Motion Detection:** useReducedMotion hook respects user preferences
- ✅ **Alternative Feedback:** ColorPulse component provides non-animated state change feedback
- ✅ **Screen Reader Support:** StateAnnouncer with aria-live="polite" regions
- ✅ **Focus Management:** Focus moved to new content after transitions (ExpandedSparkDetail)
- ✅ **Color Contrast:** Teal flash (rgba(91, 154, 153, 0.1)) meets contrast requirements
- ✅ **Keyboard Navigation:** All transitions work with keyboard-only interaction

**Testing Coverage:**
- reduced-motion.test.tsx validates zero-duration transitions when preference set
- StateAnnouncer tested for correct ARIA attributes
- Focus management implemented in ExpandedSparkDetail useEffect

**Note:** AC#6 requires testing with NVDA/JAWS screen readers - this cannot be automated and requires manual QA validation.

### Files Modified During Review

**None.** No code changes made during review. Implementation quality is high.

### Gate Status

**Gate:** CONCERNS → `/Users/philippebeliveau/Desktop/Notebook/innovation-intelligence-system/docs/qa/gates/8.6-state-transition-animations.yml`

**Quality Score:** 75/100
- Calculation: 100 - (10 × 2 medium issues) - (5 × 1 low issue) = 75

**Decision Rationale:**
- Implementation quality is excellent (GPU-accelerated, accessible, well-tested at unit level)
- Core functionality fully working (ACs 1-6 complete)
- However, **AC#7 performance testing infrastructure is incomplete** (medium severity)
- **State-machine tests broken** by animation additions (medium severity)
- Pre-existing TypeScript issues remain (low severity)

**This story demonstrates strong development work but cannot be marked Done until:**
1. Performance testing infrastructure is created (AC#7 requirement)
2. State-machine tests are fixed (regression prevention)

### Recommended Status

**⚠️ Changes Required - See unchecked items above**

The story is 85% complete with excellent implementation quality. However, **AC#7 (Performance Monitoring) explicitly requires:**

> "Test with Chrome DevTools Performance panel during QA"
> "Monitor... measure Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1"

These requirements necessitate automated performance tests, not just performance utilities. The developer created the utilities (monitorFPS, measureCLS) but did not create the test infrastructure to validate the animations meet the 60fps/CLS < 0.1 targets.

**Before marking as Done:**
1. Create `innovation-web/__tests__/performance/animation-fps.test.tsx` with:
   - FPS monitoring tests (verify 60fps maintained)
   - CLS measurement tests (verify < 0.1)
   - CPU throttling tests (30fps minimum at 4x slowdown)
2. Fix state-machine tests (update mocks for FadeTransition/StateAnnouncer)
3. (Optional but recommended) Add Playwright E2E tests for cross-browser validation

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 2-3 hours

---

**Note to Dev:** This is excellent work with a strong foundation. The performance utilities you created are well-designed. The remaining work is creating the test infrastructure to validate that the animations actually meet the performance targets specified in AC#7. The state-machine test fixes should be quick (add mocks). Great job on accessibility and animation architecture! 🎯
