# Story 8.1: Bypass Vercel Timeout with Direct Railway Backend Call

**Epic:** Epic 8 - Performance & Architecture Optimization
**Priority:** P0 (CRITICAL - Blocks document analysis functionality)
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** user analyzing documents,
**I want** the frontend to call the Railway backend directly instead of through Next.js API route,
**so that** I don't hit the 10-second Vercel timeout and my analysis completes successfully.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Frontend calls Railway backend API directly for document analysis (not through `/api/analyze-document`)
2. Frontend includes Clerk authentication token in Railway API request headers
3. Frontend still polls `/api/runs` endpoint to check analysis status
4. Existing webhook endpoint `/api/runs/[runId]/complete` remains functional for Railway callbacks
5. Remove or deprecate `/api/analyze-document` route since it's no longer needed
6. No 504 Gateway Timeout errors occur during document analysis
7. Analysis workflow completes successfully for documents that take >10 seconds to process
8. Railway backend validates Clerk authentication token before processing
9. CSP headers allow direct Railway backend connections
10. Error handling provides clear feedback for authentication failures
11. Frontend handles Railway backend errors gracefully (network failures, timeouts)
12. Existing document upload flow remains unchanged (Vercel Blob storage)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Current Problem (Broken):**
```
User Upload → /api/analyze-document (Next.js API) → LLM Analysis
                        ↓
                  504 Timeout after 10s ❌
                  (Vercel Hobby plan limit)
```

**Why This Fails:**
- `/api/analyze-document` runs in Vercel serverless function (10s max on Hobby plan)
- Document analysis takes 30-60 seconds (PDF parsing + LLM calls)
- Function times out before analysis completes
- User sees 504 Gateway Timeout error

**Target Architecture (Fixed):**
```
User Upload → Railway Backend Directly → 5-Stage Pipeline → Success ✅
                                              ↓
                                         Webhook to Vercel
                                              ↓
Frontend ← /api/runs/[runId]/complete ← Railway Backend
  ↓
Polling /api/runs every 10s → Status Updates
```

**Why This Works:**
- Railway has 60-minute timeout (not 10 seconds)
- Direct backend call bypasses Vercel function limitation
- Webhook pattern already implemented (Story 7.8)
- Polling pattern already implemented (Story 3.3)

### File Locations

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/analyze/[uploadId]/page.tsx` - Update analysis trigger to call Railway directly
- `middleware.ts` - Verify CSP allows Railway connections (line 33)

**Files to Delete:**
- `app/api/analyze-document/route.ts` - No longer needed

**Files to Keep (Unchanged):**
- `app/api/runs/route.ts` - Polling endpoint
- `app/api/runs/[runId]/complete/route.ts` - Webhook endpoint (Story 7.8)
- `app/api/upload/route.ts` - Vercel Blob upload

### Railway Backend Investigation

**Expected Railway Backend Details:**

**Endpoint:** Likely `POST {RAILWAY_BACKEND_URL}/api/analyze` or `/api/pipeline/run`

**Request Format:**
```typescript
{
  blob_url: string,      // Vercel Blob URL (publicly accessible)
  company_id: string,    // From cookie or user selection
  user_id: string,       // From Clerk authentication
  run_id?: string        // Optional: Frontend-generated runId
}
```

**Response Format:**
```typescript
{
  run_id: string,        // Railway-generated or confirmed runId
  status: "PROCESSING",  // Initial status
  message: "Pipeline started successfully"
}
```

**Authentication Options:**
1. **Clerk JWT Validation (Recommended):**
   - Frontend: `Authorization: Bearer {clerkToken}`
   - Backend: Validates token with Clerk public key
   - Most secure, user-scoped

2. **API Key (Alternative):**
   - Frontend: `X-API-Key: {shared-secret}`
   - Backend: Validates against environment variable
   - Simpler but less secure

3. **No Authentication (Current - Not Recommended):**
   - Public endpoint
   - Security risk: Anyone can trigger pipelines

**Investigation Commands:**
```bash
# Check Vercel environment variables
vercel env ls

# Check Railway backend URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL

# Test Railway endpoint manually
curl -X POST https://innovation-backend.railway.app/api/analyze \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {CLERK_TOKEN}" \
  -d '{"blob_url": "https://...", "company_id": "lactalis-canada", "user_id": "user_xxx"}'
```

### Clerk Authentication Integration

**Frontend Code Pattern:**
```typescript
'use client'
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs'

export default function AnalyzePage() {
  const { getToken, userId } = useAuth()

  const analyzeDocument = async (blobUrl: string) => {
    // Get Clerk session token
    const token = await getToken()

    if (!token || !userId) {
      throw new Error('Authentication required')
    }

    // Call Railway backend directly
    const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL}/api/analyze`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        blob_url: blobUrl,
        company_id: companyId, // From cookie or state
        user_id: userId
      })
    })

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Analysis failed: ${response.statusText}`)
    }

    const data = await response.json()
    return data.run_id
  }
}
```

**Backend Validation (Python - Railway):**
```python
from clerk_backend_api import Clerk
import os

clerk = Clerk(bearer_auth=os.getenv("CLERK_SECRET_KEY"))

def validate_clerk_token(token: str) -> dict:
    """Validate Clerk JWT and return user info"""
    try:
        # Verify JWT with Clerk API
        session = clerk.verify_token(token)
        return {
            "user_id": session.user_id,
            "valid": True
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "valid": False,
            "error": str(e)
        }
```

### CSP Configuration

**Current CSP (middleware.ts:33):**
```typescript
"connect-src 'self' blob: https://*.clerk.accounts.dev https://*.clerk.com https://*.clerk.dev https://*.vercel-storage.com https://*.railway.app https://*.clerk-telemetry.com"
```

**Railway Domain Already Allowed:** ✓ `https://*.railway.app`

No CSP changes needed (Story 7.8 already added Railway domain).

### Error Handling Patterns

**Network Errors:**
```typescript
try {
  const runId = await analyzeDocument(blobUrl)
  router.push(`/analyze/${runId}`)
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof TypeError && error.message.includes('fetch')) {
    setError('Network error: Unable to reach analysis service')
  } else if (error.message.includes('Authentication')) {
    setError('Authentication failed. Please sign in again.')
  } else {
    setError('Analysis failed. Please try again.')
  }
}
```

**Railway Backend Errors:**
- **401 Unauthorized:** Invalid Clerk token → Redirect to sign-in
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid request format → Show validation error
- **500 Server Error:** Backend failure → Show retry button
- **503 Service Unavailable:** Railway down → Show status message

### Dependencies from Previous Stories

**Story 7.8 (Pipeline Completion Webhook):**
- Webhook endpoint `/api/runs/[runId]/complete` already implemented
- Railway backend already calls webhook on pipeline completion
- Frontend already updates status from PROCESSING → COMPLETED
- This story leverages existing webhook infrastructure

**Story 3.3 (Status Polling):**
- `/api/runs` polling endpoint already implemented
- Frontend polls every 10 seconds for status updates
- Polling logic works independently of how pipeline is triggered

**Story 2.1 (LLM Document Analysis):**
- Original `/api/analyze-document` implementation
- This story REPLACES this endpoint with direct Railway call
- LLM analysis logic moves entirely to Railway backend

**Story 1.2 (File Upload Vercel Blob):**
- Upload flow remains unchanged
- Vercel Blob storage still used for PDFs
- Railway backend receives blob URL (publicly accessible)

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk:** Railway backend URL not configured in Vercel
- **Mitigation:** Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in Vercel env vars
- **Fallback:** Use Railway project URL (find in Railway dashboard)

**Risk:** Clerk authentication not implemented in Railway backend
- **Mitigation:** Implement Clerk JWT validation in Task 1
- **Fallback:** Use API key authentication temporarily

**Risk:** CORS errors when calling Railway from browser
- **Mitigation:** Railway backend must set CORS headers allowing Vercel domain
- **Fix:** Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://innovation-web-rho.vercel.app`

**Risk:** Breaking existing upload flow
- **Mitigation:** Only change analysis trigger, keep upload logic intact
- **Validation:** Test upload → analysis → results end-to-end

### Testing

#### Test Standards
- Manual integration testing (end-to-end flow)
- Browser console monitoring (network tab, errors)
- Railway logs monitoring (webhook calls, pipeline execution)
- Vercel logs monitoring (API route calls, webhook receipt)

#### Testing Checklist

1. **Happy Path:**
   - Upload document → Trigger analysis → Wait for completion → View results
   - Expected: No 504 errors, analysis completes, cards display

2. **Authentication Failure:**
   - Sign out → Try to analyze document
   - Expected: Clear error message, redirect to sign-in

3. **Network Failure:**
   - Disconnect internet → Try to analyze
   - Expected: Network error message, retry button

4. **Railway Backend Down:**
   - Temporarily stop Railway backend
   - Expected: Service unavailable message

5. **Long Document (>10s):**
   - Upload large PDF → Trigger analysis
   - Expected: Completes successfully without timeout

6. **Concurrent Analyses:**
   - Upload 3 documents → Analyze all simultaneously
   - Expected: All complete successfully

#### Test File Locations
- Manual testing only for MVP
- Future: `app/analyze/[uploadId]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
