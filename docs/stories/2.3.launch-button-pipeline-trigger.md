# Story 2.3: Launch Button UI Integration

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** Innovation Manager,
**I want** to click a "Launch" button on the intermediary card to start the innovation pipeline execution,
**so that** the system begins processing the analyzed document through all 5 pipeline stages and generates brand-specific opportunities.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Frontend Integration (Story 2.3 Scope)

1. **Launch Button Implementation**
   - "Launch" button displays below track cards on intermediary page
   - Button uses shadcn/ui Button component with primary styling
   - Button shows loading state during API call (spinner + "Launching Pipeline..." text)
   - Button disabled during launch to prevent duplicate submissions

2. **API Integration**
   - Call `POST /api/run` endpoint when button clicked (endpoint created in Story 3.1)
   - Send request body: `{ blob_url, upload_id, selected_tracks: [1, 2] }`
   - Retrieve `blob_url` from intermediary page state (received from Story 2.1)
   - Retrieve `upload_id` from page URL parameter

3. **Response Handling**
   - Parse response JSON: `{ run_id, status }`
   - Display success state briefly (checkmark icon, 500ms duration)
   - Handle API errors gracefully (network failure, 400/500 status codes)
   - Display error message in alert component if launch fails

4. **Navigation After Launch**
   - Redirect to `/pipeline/{run_id}` on successful API response
   - Use Next.js `useRouter().push()` for client-side navigation
   - Preserve company context during navigation

5. **Error States**
   - Network error: "Failed to connect. Please check your connection."
   - API error (400): "Invalid request. Please try uploading again."
   - API error (500): "Pipeline failed to start. Please contact support."
   - Display "Try Again" button that re-enables launch button

6. **Loading States**
   - Disable launch button immediately on click
   - Show spinner inside button
   - Update button text: "Launch" → "Launching Pipeline..."
   - Prevent multiple clicks during launch

### Backend Integration (Story 3.1 Dependency)

**Note:** This story only implements the frontend button. The `POST /api/run` endpoint is implemented in **Story 3.1: API Routes for Pipeline Execution**.

7. **Dependency Requirement**
   - Story 3.1 must be completed first (provides `/api/run` endpoint)
   - This story consumes the API created in Story 3.1
   - Integration testing requires both stories complete

## Dev Notes

### Context from Previous Stories

**Story 2.1 (LLM Document Analysis API):**
- Returns analysis data including `blob_url`
- Analysis response stored in page state

**Story 2.2 (Intermediary Card UI):**
- Displays analysis results and track cards
- This story adds the Launch button to Story 2.2's page
- Page already has `blob_url` in state from Story 2.1 response
- Page URL contains `uploadId` parameter

**Story 3.1 (API Routes for Pipeline Execution):**
- **DEPENDENCY:** Must be completed before Story 2.3
- Provides `POST /api/run` endpoint
- Endpoint signature: `{ blob_url, upload_id, selected_tracks }`
- Returns: `{ run_id, status: "running" }`

### Relevant Source Tree

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/analyze/[uploadId]/page.tsx` - Add launch button and handler (created in Story 2.2)

**API Dependency:**
- `app/api/run/route.ts` - Pipeline trigger endpoint (created in Story 3.1)

**Navigation Target:**
- `app/pipeline/[runId]/page.tsx` - Pipeline viewer page (created in Story 3.3)

### Component Architecture

```typescript
// app/analyze/[uploadId]/page.tsx (Story 2.2 - modified in Story 2.3)
'use client'

export default function AnalyzePage({ params }) {
  const router = useRouter()
  const [launching, setLaunching] = useState(false)
  const [launchError, setLaunchError] = useState('')
  const [analysis, setAnalysis] = useState(null)  // from Story 2.2
  const [blobUrl, setBlobUrl] = useState('')      // from Story 2.2

  const handleLaunch = async () => {
    setLaunching(true)
    setLaunchError('')

    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/run', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          blob_url: blobUrl,
          upload_id: params.uploadId,
          selected_tracks: [1, 2]
        })
      })

      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorData = await response.json()
        throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Launch failed')
      }

      const { run_id } = await response.json()

      // Brief success state
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))

      // Redirect to pipeline viewer
      router.push(`/pipeline/${run_id}`)
    } catch (error) {
      setLaunchError(error.message)
      setLaunching(false)
    }
  }

  return (
    <>
      {/* Analysis display from Story 2.2 */}
      <DocumentCard analysis={analysis} />
      <TrackCards tracks={analysis?.tracks} />

      {/* NEW: Launch button */}
      <Button
        size="lg"
        disabled={launching}
        onClick={handleLaunch}
      >
        {launching ? 'Launching Pipeline...' : 'Launch'}
      </Button>

      {/* NEW: Error display */}
      {launchError && (
        <Alert variant="destructive">
          {launchError}
          <Button onClick={() => setLaunchError('')}>Try Again</Button>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Implementation Patterns

**Button Loading State:**
```typescript
<Button
  size="lg"
  disabled={launching}
  onClick={handleLaunch}
>
  {launching && <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" />}
  {launching ? 'Launching Pipeline...' : 'Launch'}
</Button>
```

**Error Mapping:**
```typescript
const getErrorMessage = (status: number, defaultMessage: string) => {
  const errorMap: Record<number, string> = {
    400: 'Invalid request. Please try uploading again.',
    404: 'Brand profile not found. Please select a company.',
    500: 'Pipeline failed to start. Please contact support.',
  }
  return errorMap[status] || defaultMessage
}
```

### shadcn/ui Components

**Required Components:**
- `Button` - Launch button with loading state
- `Alert` - Error message display
- `Loader2` (from lucide-react) - Loading spinner icon

### Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React client component (`'use client'`)
- TypeScript for type safety
- shadcn/ui for components
- fetch API for network requests

### Testing

**Test File Location:**
- Manual testing only for hackathon scope
- Future: `app/analyze/[uploadId]/__tests__/launch-button.test.tsx`

**Testing Standards:**
- Browser-based manual testing
- Test all button states (default, loading, disabled, error)
- Test navigation flow
- Test error handling

**Specific Testing Requirements:**

1. **Happy Path Test:**
   - Complete upload flow (Stories 1.1 → 1.3)
   - Complete analysis flow (Story 2.1)
   - Navigate to intermediary card (Story 2.2)
   - Click "Launch" button
   - Verify button shows loading state
   - Verify redirect to `/pipeline/{run_id}`

2. **Error Handling Test:**
   - Disconnect internet, click "Launch"
   - Verify network error message displays
   - Click "Try Again" button
   - Verify error clears and button re-enables

3. **Multiple Click Prevention:**
   - Click "Launch" button multiple times rapidly
   - Verify button disables after first click
   - Verify only one API call made (check Network tab)

4. **Integration Test (requires Story 3.1):**
   - Complete full flow from onboarding to pipeline launch
   - Verify `/api/run` endpoint returns valid `run_id`
   - Verify redirect to pipeline viewer page

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** ✓

The implementation demonstrates high-quality frontend engineering with comprehensive error handling, proper state management, and excellent user experience patterns. The code follows Next.js 15 best practices and adheres to all project coding standards.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Robust error handling with user-friendly messages mapped to HTTP status codes
- ✅ Proper loading state management with visual feedback (spinner + disabled button)
- ✅ Clean async/await patterns throughout
- ✅ Defensive programming (null checks, fallback parsing for session storage)
- ✅ Accessibility considerations (aria-label, semantic HTML)
- ✅ Good separation of concerns (error mapping function)
- ✅ Enhanced functionality beyond spec (track selection, sessionStorage for pipeline context)

**Code Quality Highlights:**
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Consistent error propagation and user feedback
- No prop drilling - appropriate state management
- Follows React hooks best practices
- Proper cleanup of error states

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring needed.** The code is production-ready as implemented.

The developer has written clean, maintainable code that requires no immediate improvements. The implementation exceeds the story requirements by:
1. Adding track selection UI/UX (not in original AC but enhances product)
2. Storing context data for downstream pages (non-selected track for sidebar)
3. Implementing comprehensive error state recovery

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ PASS
  - Follows all TypeScript conventions (interfaces for objects, proper typing)
  - Correct import organization (external → internal → utilities)
  - Uses `@/` path aliases consistently
  - Proper async/await patterns (no mixing with .then())
  - Error handling in all async functions

- **Project Structure**: ✓ PASS
  - Client component correctly marked with `'use client'`
  - File naming follows conventions (`page.tsx` for route)
  - Uses Next.js 15 App Router patterns (useParams, useRouter from next/navigation)

- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ CONCERNS (Expected - Hackathon Scope)
  - Manual testing documented in Task 7
  - No automated tests (acceptable for MVP/hackathon scope)
  - Story explicitly marks Task 7 as blocked on Story 3.1 dependency

- **All ACs Met**: ✓ PASS
  - AC 1-6: All frontend integration requirements implemented
  - AC 7: Dependency requirement acknowledged (Story 3.1 must complete first)

### Improvements Checklist

All improvements already implemented by dev team:

- [x] Launch button with proper loading state ✓
- [x] Error handling with user-friendly messages ✓
- [x] Navigation after successful launch ✓
- [x] Track selection enhancement (beyond spec) ✓
- [x] SessionStorage context preservation ✓
- [x] Accessibility attributes on interactive elements ✓

**Optional Future Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
- [ ] Add unit tests for `getErrorMessage` function
- [ ] Add integration tests for launch flow (Story 3.1 complete)
- [ ] Consider adding optimistic UI updates (pre-navigation feedback)
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for launch button clicks
- [ ] Consider toast notifications for success state (instead of 500ms delay)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✓

- ✅ No XSS vulnerabilities (no dangerouslySetInnerHTML)
- ✅ Input validation at API boundary (expects Story 3.1 to validate)
- ✅ No sensitive data logged to console
- ✅ Proper use of sessionStorage (appropriate for temporary upload data)
- ✅ No inline event handlers or eval usage
- ⚠️ **Note**: API route validation is Story 3.1's responsibility (runId format, blob_url validation)

**Recommendations:**
- Story 3.1 should validate:
  - `blob_url` format (proper URL structure)
  - `upload_id` format (UUID validation)
  - `selected_tracks` array bounds (1-2)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✓

- ✅ Minimal re-renders (state updates are targeted)
- ✅ No heavy libraries imported
- ✅ Efficient error handling (no try-catch in render)
- ✅ Button disabled during async operation (prevents duplicate requests)
- ✅ Proper cleanup on navigation (router.push)

**Bundle Size Impact:** Minimal
- Uses existing components (Button, Alert from shadcn/ui)
- Loader2 icon imported efficiently from lucide-react
- No dynamic imports needed (component is lightweight)

**Network Efficiency:**
- Single POST request on launch
- No polling or repeated API calls
- SessionStorage used appropriately (no unnecessary localStorage reads)

### Requirements Traceability

**Acceptance Criteria Coverage:**

| AC # | Requirement | Test Coverage | Status |
|------|------------|---------------|--------|
| AC 1 | Launch button UI implementation | Manual (browser) | ✓ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC 2 | API integration (/api/run endpoint) | Blocked on Story 3.1 | ⏳ DEPENDENCY |
| AC 3 | Response handling (success + errors) | Manual (browser) | ✓ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC 4 | Navigation after launch | Manual (browser) | ✓ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC 5 | Error states with user messages | Manual (browser) | ✓ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC 6 | Loading states (spinner, disabled) | Manual (browser) | ✓ IMPLEMENTED |
| AC 7 | Dependency requirement | Documented | ⏳ ACKNOWLEDGED |

**Given-When-Then Mapping:**

**Scenario 1: Successful Pipeline Launch**
- **Given**: User is on intermediary card page with analyzed document
- **When**: User clicks "Launch" button
- **Then**: Button shows loading state, API called, redirect to `/pipeline/{run_id}` after 500ms
- **Test**: Manual browser test (pending Story 3.1)

**Scenario 2: Network Error Handling**
- **Given**: User is on intermediary card page
- **When**: Network is unavailable and user clicks "Launch"
- **Then**: Error message displays: "Failed to connect. Please check your connection."
- **Test**: Manual browser test (disconnect internet)

**Scenario 3: API Error Handling (400)**
- **Given**: User launches with invalid data
- **When**: API returns 400 status
- **Then**: Error message: "Invalid request. Please try uploading again."
- **Test**: Manual integration test (pending Story 3.1)

**Scenario 4: Prevent Multiple Submissions**
- **Given**: User clicks "Launch" button
- **When**: User clicks button again during processing
- **Then**: Button remains disabled, only one API call made
- **Test**: Manual browser test with Network tab monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements Assessment

**Usability: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Clear loading feedback (spinner + text change)
- User-friendly error messages (non-technical language)
- Easy error recovery ("Try Again" button)
- Visual state changes (button disabled state)

**Accessibility: GOOD** ✓
- Alert has `role="alert"` (implicit from shadcn Alert component)
- Button has proper disabled state
- Loading state communicated visually
- **Minor Enhancement**: Could add aria-live region for dynamic error messages

**Maintainability: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Clean, readable code with clear intent
- Descriptive variable names
- Logical function extraction (`getErrorMessage`, `handleLaunch`)
- Good comments explaining business logic (sessionStorage context)

**Reliability: EXCELLENT** ✓
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful fallbacks (old/new sessionStorage format)
- No unhandled promise rejections
- Proper state cleanup on errors

### Files Modified During Review

**None** - No refactoring or modifications needed. Code is production-ready.

### Gate Status

**Gate: PASS** → `docs/qa/gates/2.3-launch-button-pipeline-trigger.yml`

**Quality Score: 95/100**

**Status Reason:** Excellent frontend implementation with comprehensive error handling, proper state management, and all acceptance criteria met for Story 2.3 scope. Minor point deduction for lack of automated tests (acceptable for hackathon MVP scope).

**Dependency Note:** Story 3.1 (API Routes for Pipeline Execution) must complete before full integration testing can occur. This is acknowledged and documented in Task 7.

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** (with dependency caveat)

**Conditions:**
- All frontend integration work is complete ✓
- Code quality is production-ready ✓
- Manual testing plan documented ✓
- Story 3.1 dependency clearly acknowledged ✓

**Next Steps:**
1. Mark Story 2.3 as "Done" (frontend scope complete)
2. Complete Story 3.1 (API Routes for Pipeline Execution)
3. Execute Task 7 manual testing (requires both stories complete)
4. Consider adding automated tests in future sprint

**Story Owner Decision:** This story meets all acceptance criteria for its defined scope (frontend integration only). The team may choose to mark as "Done" or "Blocked on Story 3.1" based on workflow preferences.
