# Story 1.2: File Upload to Vercel Blob

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Core Upload & File Management
**Priority:** P0
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** Innovation Manager,
**I want** to upload market signal documents (PDFs, text files, markdown) to cloud storage,
**so that** the pipeline can process my files and generate brand-specific innovation opportunities.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. API route exists at `POST /api/upload`
2. Endpoint accepts multipart/form-data with single file field
3. Returns JSON response with structure: `{upload_id, blob_url, file_name, file_size, uploaded_at}`
4. Accepts only file types: `application/pdf`, `text/plain`, `text/markdown`
5. File extensions must match MIME type (`.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`)
6. Rejects invalid file types with 400 status and error: `{"error": "Invalid file type"}`
7. Maximum file size is 25MB (Vercel Blob limit)
8. Rejects oversized files with 400 status and error: `{"error": "File too large (max 25MB)"}`
9. File size check happens before upload to Blob
10. Files stored with path pattern: `uploads/{timestamp}-{original-filename}`
11. Blob access level is `public` (allows direct URL access)
12. Blob URL is publicly accessible without authentication
13. Upload completes in < 5 seconds for 10MB file
14. Python pipeline file reading remains unchanged (expects local file paths)
15. No modifications to `scripts/run_pipeline.py` in this story
16. Upload ID format: `upload-{unix-timestamp-milliseconds}`
17. Upload ID is unique per upload (timestamp ensures uniqueness)
18. Upload ID used as key for tracking throughout system
19. API reads `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` from environment variables
20. Handles Vercel Blob SDK errors gracefully
21. Returns 500 status if Blob service unavailable
22. Missing file in request returns: `{"error": "No file provided"}` (400)
23. Blob upload failure returns: `{"error": "Upload failed"}` (500)
24. Network timeout returns: `{"error": "Upload timeout"}` (500)
25. All errors logged server-side with stack traces
26. Implements retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
27. Temporary failures trigger retry before returning error
28. API response time < 2 seconds for files under 5MB
29. No memory leaks (files streamed, not fully loaded to memory)
30. Concurrent uploads supported (no file locking issues)

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Integration Point:** Python pipeline expects local file paths (`--input-file /path/to/file.pdf`)
- **No Changes:** Python pipeline code (`scripts/run_pipeline.py`) remains unchanged in this story
- **Future Integration:** Epic 3 will download from Blob URL to `/tmp/` before pipeline execution
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15 API Routes, Vercel Blob SDK, Node.js 20.x

### API Route Location
- **File:** `app/api/upload/route.ts`
- **HTTP Method:** POST
- **Content-Type:** multipart/form-data
- **Response Format:** JSON

### Vercel Blob Configuration
- **Storage Path Pattern:** `uploads/{timestamp}-{filename}`
- **Access Level:** `public` (no authentication required for URL access)
- **Token:** `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` environment variable
- **Free Tier:** 1GB storage (sufficient for hackathon)
- **File Size Limit:** 25MB (enforced by API validation)

### Upload ID Format
- **Format:** `upload-{unix-timestamp-milliseconds}`
- **Example:** `upload-1729349025123`
- **Purpose:** Unique identifier for tracking upload throughout system
- **Usage:** Key for sessionStorage (Story 1.3) and pipeline execution (Epic 3)

### Retry Logic
- **Attempts:** 3 maximum
- **Backoff:** Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Algorithm:** `Math.pow(2, attempts) * 1000` milliseconds
- **Failure:** After 3 attempts, return 500 error

### Response Schema
```typescript
{
  upload_id: string,           // "upload-1729349025123"
  blob_url: string,            // "https://blob.vercel-storage.com/uploads/..."
  file_name: string,           // "savannah-bananas.pdf"
  file_size: number,           // 1234567 (bytes)
  uploaded_at: string          // "2025-10-19T14:23:45.123Z" (ISO 8601)
}
```

### Error Handling
| Scenario | Status | Error Message |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Missing file | 400 | `{"error": "No file provided"}` |
| Invalid file type | 400 | `{"error": "Invalid file type"}` |
| File too large | 400 | `{"error": "File too large (max 25MB)"}` |
| Blob upload failed | 500 | `{"error": "Upload failed"}` |
| Network timeout | 500 | `{"error": "Upload timeout"}` |

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@vercel/blob": "^0.15.0"
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# .env.local
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=vercel_blob_rw_...
```

**How to get token:**
1. Deploy to Vercel (or run `vercel env pull`)
2. Token auto-generated on first Blob operation
3. Copy from Vercel dashboard > Storage > Blob > Settings

### Code Structure
```typescript
// app/api/upload/route.ts
import { put } from '@vercel/blob'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // 1. Extract file from form data
  // 2. Validate file type and size
  // 3. Upload to Blob with retry logic
  // 4. Generate upload ID
  // 5. Return response with metadata
}
```

### Testing

#### Test File Location
- Use existing test file: `data/test-inputs/savannah-bananas.pdf`
- Create additional test files: small.txt, large.md, oversized.pdf (30MB)

#### Testing Standards
- **API Testing:** Use curl or Postman for HTTP requests
- **Performance:** Measure response time with `time` command
- **Error Scenarios:** Test all validation and error cases
- **Concurrent Uploads:** Test multiple simultaneous uploads

#### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Manual API testing with curl
- No automated tests for hackathon scope
- Performance testing with time measurement

#### Specific Testing Requirements
1. Test all 3 supported file types (PDF, TXT, MD)
2. Test file size boundaries (1MB, 10MB, 24MB, 30MB)
3. Test invalid file types (.exe, .jpg, .zip)
4. Verify blob URL is publicly accessible (curl GET)
5. Test retry logic (simulate network failure)
6. Verify Python CLI still works unchanged

### Test Commands
```bash
# Test valid PDF upload
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "file=@data/test-inputs/savannah-bananas.pdf"

# Test invalid file type
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "file=@test.exe"

# Test oversized file
dd if=/dev/zero of=large.pdf bs=1M count=30
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/upload \
  -F "file=@large.pdf"

# Verify blob URL accessibility
BLOB_URL="<url_from_response>"
curl -I $BLOB_URL  # Expect: HTTP 200 OK
```

### Rollback Plan
If Blob storage fails:
1. Modify API to save files to `/tmp/` directory
2. Return local file path instead of Blob URL
3. Pipeline reads from `/tmp/` instead of downloading
