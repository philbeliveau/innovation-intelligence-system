# Story 1.4: Upload History Display with Card Navigation

**Epic:** Epic 1 - Core Upload & File Management
**Priority:** P2
**Estimated Time:** 1.5-2 hours

---

## Status

**Ready for Review**

---

## Story

**As a** Innovation Manager,
**I want** to see my previously uploaded documents as cards below the upload zone,
**so that** I can easily navigate back to previous analyses without losing context.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Behavior Changes
1. Remove automatic redirect from Story 1.3 AC 19 - user stays on `/upload` after successful upload
2. On upload success, add upload metadata to localStorage instead of immediately redirecting
3. User can upload multiple documents in a single session without navigation

### LocalStorage Implementation
4. Store upload history in browser localStorage with key format: `upload_history_${company_id}`
5. Upload metadata structure includes: `upload_id`, `filename`, `uploaded_at` (timestamp), `blob_url`, `company_id`
6. Upload history is an array of upload metadata objects
7. Maximum 20 uploads stored per company (FIFO - oldest removed when exceeding limit)
8. Upload history persists across browser sessions
9. Upload history is company-scoped - each company has separate history
10. On successful upload, append new upload to history array and save to localStorage
11. Handle localStorage quota errors gracefully with fallback (log warning, continue without history)

### Section Display
12. "or Select a Starting Points" section heading displays below upload zone when history exists
13. Section heading uses same typography as reference design (`docs/image/main-page.png`)
14. Section is hidden when no upload history exists for current company
15. Section appears immediately after first successful upload (no page reload required)

### Document Cards Display
16. Display up to 4 most recent uploads as cards in horizontal layout
17. If more than 4 uploads exist, enable horizontal scroll with visual scroll indicators
18. Cards display in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
19. Each card has coral/pink gradient background matching reference design
20. Card layout matches reference design style from `docs/image/main-page.png`
21. Cards have equal width (responsive: mobile stacked, tablet/desktop horizontal)
22. Cards have hover state with slight scale transform and shadow increase

### Card Content
23. Each card displays document icon (📄 emoji or gradient placeholder)
24. Each card displays filename truncated to 40 characters with "..." if longer
25. Each card displays upload timestamp as relative time ("2 hours ago", "Yesterday", "3 days ago")
26. Each card shows "Food & Beverage" category label (static for hackathon scope)
27. Card text is readable with proper contrast against gradient background
28. Filename is bold, timestamp is regular weight
29. Card has small close icon (❌) in top-right corner (optional - delete functionality)

### Card Interaction
30. Clicking anywhere on card navigates to `/analyze/{upload_id}`
31. Card click uses client-side navigation (no page reload)
32. Card has proper hover cursor (pointer)
33. Card has keyboard accessibility (Tab to focus, Enter to navigate)
34. Card has `role="button"` and proper ARIA labels
35. Optional: Close icon click removes upload from history without navigation

### Company Context Filtering
36. Only display uploads where `company_id` matches current company cookie
37. When company context changes (user selects different company), history updates to show that company's uploads
38. Handle case where localStorage contains uploads for companies no longer in system (gracefully skip)

### Empty State
39. When no upload history exists, hide entire "or Select a Starting Points" section
40. No placeholder or empty state message needed (section simply doesn't render)

### Error Handling
41. Handle missing localStorage gracefully (feature disabled in private browsing)
42. Handle corrupted localStorage data (JSON parse errors) - clear and restart
43. Handle missing `company_id` in upload metadata (skip that upload in display)
44. Log errors to console for debugging but don't show user-facing errors

### Accessibility
45. Cards are keyboard navigable with Tab key
46. Cards respond to Enter/Space key for navigation
47. Screen readers announce card content: "Navigate to {filename}, uploaded {relative_time}"
48. Section has proper semantic HTML structure

### Performance
49. LocalStorage read happens once on page load (cached in component state)
50. LocalStorage write happens only on new upload (not on every render)
51. Relative time formatting updates every minute for accuracy (use setInterval)
52. No layout shift when history section appears/disappears

## Dev Notes

### Existing System Integration
- **Depends on:** Story 1.1 (company cookie), Story 1.2 (upload API), Story 1.3 (upload page)
- **Modifies:** Story 1.3 - Remove AC 19 (automatic redirect behavior)
- **Integration Points:**
  - Reads `company_id` cookie set by Story 1.1
  - Captures upload metadata from `POST /api/upload` response (Story 1.2)
  - Modifies upload success handler in `app/upload/page.tsx` (Story 1.3)
  - Stores history in localStorage instead of sessionStorage
- **Technology Stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, localStorage API, shadcn/ui

### Route Structure
- **This Route:** Modifies `app/upload/page.tsx` - No new route created
- **Navigation Target:** `/analyze/{uploadId}` - Analysis page from Epic 2

### Component Architecture
```
app/
  upload/
    page.tsx                 # Modified: Remove redirect, add history section
components/
  upload/
    UploadHistorySection.tsx # New: Section container with heading
    UploadHistoryCard.tsx    # New: Individual card component
lib/
  upload-history.ts          # New: LocalStorage utility functions
  format-relative-time.ts    # New: Time formatting utility
```

### TypeScript Interfaces
```typescript
// lib/upload-history.ts
interface UploadMetadata {
  upload_id: string
  filename: string
  uploaded_at: number  // Unix timestamp
  blob_url: string
  company_id: string
}

// Component props
interface UploadHistorySectionProps {
  companyId: string
}

interface UploadHistoryCardProps {
  upload: UploadMetadata
  onDelete?: () => void
}
```

### LocalStorage Key Format
- **Key Pattern:** `upload_history_${company_id}`
- **Examples:**
  - `upload_history_lactalis-canada`
  - `upload_history_columbia-sportswear`
  - `upload_history_decathlon-canada`
- **Value:** JSON stringified array of `UploadMetadata[]`
- **Max Size:** 20 uploads per company (FIFO)

### LocalStorage Utility Functions
```typescript
// lib/upload-history.ts

export function getUploadHistory(companyId: string): UploadMetadata[] {
  try {
    const key = `upload_history_${companyId}`
    const data = localStorage.getItem(key)
    if (!data) return []
    return JSON.parse(data)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to read upload history:', error)
    return []
  }
}

export function addUploadToHistory(
  companyId: string,
  upload: UploadMetadata
): void {
  try {
    const history = getUploadHistory(companyId)
    history.unshift(upload) // Add to beginning (most recent first)

    // Enforce 20-upload limit (FIFO)
    if (history.length > 20) {
      history.pop() // Remove oldest
    }

    const key = `upload_history_${companyId}`
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(history))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to save upload history:', error)
    // Gracefully degrade - don't block upload flow
  }
}

export function removeUploadFromHistory(
  companyId: string,
  uploadId: string
): void {
  try {
    const history = getUploadHistory(companyId)
    const filtered = history.filter(u => u.upload_id !== uploadId)
    const key = `upload_history_${companyId}`
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(filtered))
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to remove from upload history:', error)
  }
}

export function clearUploadHistory(companyId: string): void {
  try {
    const key = `upload_history_${companyId}`
    localStorage.removeItem(key)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to clear upload history:', error)
  }
}
```

### Relative Time Formatting
```typescript
// lib/format-relative-time.ts

export function formatRelativeTime(timestamp: number): string {
  const now = Date.now()
  const diffMs = now - timestamp
  const diffMinutes = Math.floor(diffMs / (1000 * 60))
  const diffHours = Math.floor(diffMs / (1000 * 60 * 60))
  const diffDays = Math.floor(diffMs / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))
  const diffWeeks = Math.floor(diffDays / 7)

  if (diffMinutes < 1) return 'Just now'
  if (diffMinutes < 60) return `${diffMinutes} minute${diffMinutes === 1 ? '' : 's'} ago`
  if (diffHours < 24) return `${diffHours} hour${diffHours === 1 ? '' : 's'} ago`
  if (diffDays === 1) return 'Yesterday'
  if (diffDays < 7) return `${diffDays} days ago`
  if (diffWeeks < 4) return `${diffWeeks} week${diffWeeks === 1 ? '' : 's'} ago`

  // Fallback to date string for older uploads
  const date = new Date(timestamp)
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-US', { month: 'short', day: 'numeric', year: 'numeric' })
}
```

### Modifications to Story 1.3 Upload Page
```typescript
// app/upload/page.tsx - Modified upload success handler

// OLD (Story 1.3 AC 19):
const handleUpload = async () => {
  // ... upload logic ...
  sessionStorage.setItem(`upload_${upload_id}`, blob_url)
  router.push(`/analyze/${upload_id}`) // ❌ Remove this
}

// NEW (Story 1.4):
const handleUpload = async () => {
  // ... upload logic ...
  sessionStorage.setItem(`upload_${upload_id}`, blob_url)

  // Add to history instead of redirect
  addUploadToHistory(companyId, {
    upload_id,
    filename: file.name,
    uploaded_at: Date.now(),
    blob_url,
    company_id: companyId
  })

  // Reset form state for next upload
  setUploading(false)
  setUploadProgress(0)
  setFileName('')
  setFileSize(0)

  // Show success message
  setSuccessMessage(`✓ ${file.name} uploaded successfully`)
  setTimeout(() => setSuccessMessage(''), 3000)
}
```

### Visual Design Reference
- Reference image: `docs/image/main-page.png` (bottom section)
- Card gradient: Coral (#FF6B6B) to pink (#FFB6C1) gradient
- Card dimensions: ~280px width, ~160px height (responsive)
- Card spacing: 16px gap between cards
- Hover state: scale(1.02) + shadow increase
- Typography: Filename bold 16px, timestamp regular 14px gray

### Card Layout Specification
```typescript
// Tailwind CSS classes for card
className="
  relative
  w-[280px] h-[160px]
  rounded-lg
  bg-gradient-to-br from-coral-500 to-pink-400
  p-4
  cursor-pointer
  transition-all duration-200
  hover:scale-[1.02] hover:shadow-xl
  focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500
"
```

### Dependencies
- No new npm packages required
- Uses native localStorage API
- Uses existing shadcn/ui components (if needed for styling)
- Uses Next.js `useRouter` for navigation

### Testing

#### Test File Preparation
- Use existing: `data/test-inputs/savannah-bananas.pdf`
- Create additional test files for multiple uploads
- Test with various filename lengths (short, medium, 40+ chars)

#### Testing Standards
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Safari, Firefox (desktop only)
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Full keyboard accessibility required
- **Screen Readers:** ARIA labels and semantic HTML required
- **TypeScript:** Zero compilation errors
- **LocalStorage:** Test with localStorage disabled (private browsing)

#### Specific Testing Requirements
1. Upload 1 file → verify card appears immediately
2. Upload 2 more files → verify 3 cards display in correct order
3. Click card → verify navigation to `/analyze/{uploadId}`
4. Refresh page → verify history persists
5. Switch company → verify history filters correctly
6. Upload 21 files → verify oldest removed (20-limit enforced)
7. Clear localStorage → verify graceful degradation
8. Test keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter)
9. Test with all 4 company contexts
10. Test in private browsing mode (localStorage disabled)

#### Test Scenarios
```bash
# Manual test flow:
1. Complete Story 1.3 setup (company cookie, upload page)
2. Navigate to /upload
3. Upload file via drag & drop
4. Verify NO redirect happens (stay on /upload)
5. Verify "or Select a Starting Points" section appears
6. Verify 1 card displays with correct filename/timestamp
7. Upload 2 more files in same session
8. Verify 3 cards display in reverse chronological order
9. Click middle card
10. Verify navigation to correct `/analyze/{uploadId}`
11. Navigate back to /upload
12. Verify all 3 cards still visible
13. Open browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage
14. Verify key: upload_history_{company_id} with JSON array value
15. Refresh page
16. Verify history persists (cards still visible)
17. Switch company via landing page
18. Navigate to /upload
19. Verify NO cards show (different company context)
```

### Edge Cases to Handle
1. **localStorage disabled (private browsing):** Feature gracefully disabled, no errors
2. **Corrupted localStorage data:** Clear and restart with empty array
3. **Missing company_id in upload:** Skip that upload in display
4. **Company no longer exists:** Skip uploads for invalid companies
5. **Clock skew (timestamp in future):** Handle gracefully with "Just now"
6. **Very long filenames:** Truncate to 40 chars with "..."
7. **Special characters in filename:** Display correctly (no XSS risk)
8. **Rapid uploads:** Queue history updates to avoid race conditions

### Performance Considerations
- **localStorage read:** Only on component mount (not every render)
- **localStorage write:** Only on new upload (debounced if needed)
- **Relative time updates:** setInterval at 60-second intervals (clean up on unmount)
- **Horizontal scroll:** Use CSS `scroll-snap` for smooth experience
- **Re-renders:** Use React.memo for UploadHistoryCard to prevent unnecessary re-renders

### Security Considerations
- **XSS risk:** Sanitize filename display (use textContent, not innerHTML)
- **localStorage size:** Enforce 20-upload limit to prevent bloat
- **Company isolation:** Always filter by current company_id (no cross-company data leaks)
- **Blob URL validity:** Vercel Blob URLs may expire - consider showing "expired" badge for old uploads

### Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)
- [ ] Backend persistence (replace localStorage with database)
- [ ] Infinite scroll for >4 uploads
- [ ] Search/filter history by filename
- [ ] Delete upload from history with confirmation modal
- [ ] Upload thumbnail previews (PDF first page, etc.)
- [ ] Export history as CSV
- [ ] Share upload link with team members
- [ ] Bulk delete/select functionality
