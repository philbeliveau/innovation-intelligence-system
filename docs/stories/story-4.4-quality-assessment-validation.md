# Story 4.4: Quality Assessment and Business Hypothesis Validation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** product manager,
**I want** structured quality assessment of all 100 opportunity cards using scoring rubric,
**so that** I can validate whether pipeline outputs justify customer payment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Quality scoring rubric created in `docs/opportunity-quality-rubric.md`:
   - **Novelty (1-5):** Is this a fresh idea, or obvious/generic?
   - **Actionability (1-5):** Are next steps concrete and implementable?
   - **Relevance (1-5):** Does this authentically fit the brand's context and capabilities?
   - **Specificity (1-5):** Is this detailed enough to act on, or too vague?
   - **Overall Score:** Average of 4 dimensions
2. Sampling strategy: Review 20 randomly selected opportunity cards (20% of total) using rubric
3. Quality assessment spreadsheet created: `data/quality-assessment.csv` with columns: opportunity_id, brand, input_source, novelty, actionability, relevance, specificity, overall_score, notes
4. Manual scoring completed by PM on 20 sampled opportunities
5. Results analysis:
   - Average overall score calculated (target: ≥3.5 per KPI table)
   - % of opportunities scoring ≥3.0 (target: ≥70%)
   - Breakdown by dimension: which dimensions are strong/weak?
6. Differentiation validation: Select 5 opportunities generated from same input across different brands, verify they are meaningfully different (qualitative assessment)
7. Business hypothesis validation documented in `docs/validation-results.md`:
   - **Transformation works?** Can pipeline systematically generate opportunities from signals? (Yes/No + evidence)
   - **Quality sufficient?** Would innovation teams pay for these opportunities? (Yes/No + rationale)
   - **Differentiation proven?** Do outputs vary meaningfully by brand? (Yes/No + examples)
   - **Speed feasible?** Can we deliver daily opportunities? (Yes/No + execution time data)
   - **Recommendation:** Proceed to productionization, pivot, or iterate? (Decision + reasoning)

## Dev Notes

**Epic:** Epic 4 - Opportunity Generation & Complete Testing (Stage 5)

**Dependencies:**
- Story 4.3 (Complete 20-Test Batch Execution)

**Technical Requirements:**
- This is the critical business hypothesis validation story
- Manual quality assessment (no automation for MVP)
- 20% sample (20 cards) statistically sufficient for validation
- Target: ≥3.5 average score, ≥70% scoring 3.0+

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- This story determines product viability
- Quality scoring validates value proposition
- Differentiation assessment validates core hypothesis
- Business validation drives strategic decision

**Success Criteria:**
- Average score ≥3.5 (KPI target)
- ≥70% of opportunities score ≥3.0
- Meaningful differentiation across brands demonstrated
- Clear strategic recommendation documented

### Testing
**Test file location:** Quality assessment spreadsheet and validation documents
**Test standards:** Manual scoring with defined rubric
**Testing frameworks:** Manual quality assessment
**Specific requirements:**
- Score 20 randomly sampled opportunities (20% of total)
- Use 4-dimension rubric (Novelty, Actionability, Relevance, Specificity)
- Achieve ≥3.5 average overall score
- Achieve ≥70% scoring ≥3.0
- Validate differentiation across brands
- Document business hypothesis validation
