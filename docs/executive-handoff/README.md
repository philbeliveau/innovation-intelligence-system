## Frequently Asked Questions

### For Executives

**Q: What did we actually build?**
A: A 5-stage AI pipeline that automatically transforms market signals (trend reports, competitor moves, technology news) into brand-specific innovation opportunities. Tested with 24 scenarios across 4 brands.

**Q: Is the quality good enough to sell?**
A: Yes. Average quality score of 3.87/5.0 with 90.9% passing professional standards. Comparable to $5,000+ consulting reports.

**Q: How long would productionization take?**
A: 9 months with 2-3 engineers. Estimated investment: ~$800K. See [Productionization Roadmap](../annexes/productionization-roadmap.md).

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: Novelty scores are moderate (3.18/5.0). Opportunities are solid but not breakthrough. Solvable with enhanced data sources and prompt engineering.

### For Business Stakeholders

**Q: How does brand contextualization work?**
A: Stage 4 uses detailed brand profiles (strategy, capabilities, customers) to adapt universal principles into brand-specific opportunities. See [Pipeline Process](pipeline-process.md#stage-4-brand-contextualization).

**Q: Can it handle different industries?**
A: Yes. Tested across CPG (McCormick, Lactalis), outdoor/sports (Columbia, Decathlon). Cross-industry inspiration is a key strength.

**Q: How do we ensure quality?**
A: 4-dimension rubric (Novelty, Actionability, Relevance, Specificity). Each scored 1-5. See [Validation Results](../annexes/validation-results.md#quality-assessment-methodology).

### For Technical Teams

**Q: What technology stack?**
A: Python + LangChain + Claude Sonnet 4.5 via OpenRouter. See [Technical Architecture](../annexes/technical-architecture.md#technology-stack).

**Q: Why did 2 scenarios fail?**
A: JSON parsing errors in Stage 5 (8.3% failure rate). Fixable with structured output validation. See [Productionization Roadmap](../annexes/productionization-roadmap.md#1-stage-5-json-parsing-failures).

**Q: How scalable is this?**
A: Current: 2.4 min/opportunity, sequential execution. Production target: <2 min with parallel processing. See [Technical Architecture](../annexes/technical-architecture.md#scalability).
