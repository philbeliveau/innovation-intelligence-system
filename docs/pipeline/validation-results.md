- **Target:** 5-10 opportunities per day
- **Time Required:** 18.5 - 37 minutes
- **Feasibility:** ✅ Highly feasible with single-server deployment

**Scenario 3: Large-Batch Generation (Tier 3 Enterprise)**
- **Target:** 50 opportunities per week (10/day × 5 days)
- **Time Required:** ~185 minutes (3.1 hours)
- **Feasibility:** ✅ Achievable with overnight batch processing

### Scalability Analysis

**Current Performance (Single Thread):**
- 22 opportunities in 57.3 minutes
- ~23 opportunities per hour sustained throughput

**Optimized Performance (Parallel Processing):**
- Stages 1-3 can run in parallel for multiple inputs
- Stage 4-5 can run in parallel for multiple brands
- **Estimated throughput: 60-80 opportunities per hour** with 4-core parallelization

**Production Recommendations:**
1. **Daily Tier Delivery:** Run overnight batch (12am - 6am) → publish at 8am
2. **Quality over Speed:** Maintain 2-3 minute runtime for quality outputs
3. **Retry Logic:** 2 retry attempts for failed scenarios (observed 8.3% failure rate)
4. **Monitoring:** Alert on >15% failure rate or >5 minute average runtime

### Conclusion
Daily opportunity delivery is **highly feasible** with current pipeline performance. Even accounting for production overhead, quality checks, and retries, pipeline can deliver 10-20 opportunities per day per brand with single-server deployment.
