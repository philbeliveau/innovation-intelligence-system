# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Product Vision

Build a web-based interface for the Innovation Intelligence Pipeline that enables users to upload market signal documents (PDFs, trend reports) and receive 5 brand-specific innovation opportunities through a real-time, visually engaging pipeline execution experience.

**Key Change:** Team-led onboarding flow where company context is pre-selected before homepage access, enabling clean client presentations without multi-brand selector UI.

## 1.2 Success Criteria

- **Time Constraint:** Complete implementation in 8-10 hours (1 hackathon day)
- **Core Functionality:** Upload → Process → Results flow works end-to-end
- **User Experience:** Beautiful, minimal UI showing real-time pipeline progress
- **Technical Validation:** Existing Python pipeline runs unchanged from web interface
- **Deployment:** Live on Vercel with public URL

## 1.3 Out of Scope (Post-Hackathon)

- User authentication and accounts
- Historical run management
- Collaborative features
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Custom brand profile creation
- Multi-file batch processing
- Mobile optimization
