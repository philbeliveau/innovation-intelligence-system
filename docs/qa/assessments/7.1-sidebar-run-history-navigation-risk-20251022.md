Date: 2025-10-22
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Story: 7.1.sidebar-run-history-navigation.md

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 7
- **Critical Risks:** 0
- **High Risks:** 1
- **Medium Risks:** 3
- **Low Risks:** 3
- **Risk Score:** 78/100 (Low-Medium Risk)

**Overall Assessment:** The implementation shows solid technical execution with comprehensive test coverage. The primary concern is the incomplete database integration in the API layer, which creates data accuracy risks. All other risks are manageable with existing mitigations or minor improvements.

---

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**None identified.** No risks scored 9 (Critical).

---

## High Risks (Score 6)

### DATA-001: Incomplete Pipeline Status Tracking

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability:** High (3) - Hardcoded status values guaranteed to occur
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Users see incorrect run statuses

**Description:**
The `/api/runs/route.ts` currently hardcodes all runs as `COMPLETED` status with `cardCount = 0` (lines 79-80). Real pipeline processing states (PROCESSING, FAILED, CANCELLED) are not tracked, making the feature non-functional for its primary use case (monitoring active runs).

**Affected Components:**
- `innovation-web/app/api/runs/route.ts` (lines 76-94)
- `LeftSidebar.tsx` status badge rendering (lines 72-92)
- `useRuns.ts` polling logic (unnecessary if statuses don't change)

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 79-80 in route.ts
const status: RunStatus = 'COMPLETED'
const cardCount = 0 // Placeholder
```

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Integrate with Prisma database** (Story 7.7 dependency)
   - Add `PipelineRun` table with columns: `id`, `userId`, `documentName`, `companyName`, `status`, `cardCount`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`
   - Replace Vercel Blob metadata parsing with database queries

2. **Update pipeline execution to write status updates**
   - Modify `scripts/run_pipeline.py` to insert/update database records
   - Track state transitions: PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED

3. **Add database queries in API route**
   ```typescript
   // Replace lines 56-102 with Prisma query
   const runs = await prisma.pipelineRun.findMany({
     where: { userId },
     orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
     skip: (page - 1) * pageSize,
     take: pageSize,
   })
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Integration test:** Verify API returns actual database statuses
- **E2E test:** Run pipeline → verify status updates in sidebar
- **Load test:** Ensure polling doesn't overwhelm database (10-second intervals)

**Residual Risk:**
Low - Once database integration is complete, risk drops to minimal. Temporary workaround: Show all runs as "Completed" with disclaimer in UI.

**Owner:** Dev Team
**Timeline:** Blocked by Story 7.7 (Prisma Database Setup) - Address in Sprint 2

---

## Medium Risks (Score 4)

### PERF-001: Unoptimized Polling Strategy

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Will occur under normal usage
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Unnecessary API calls degrade performance

**Description:**
The `useRuns.ts` hook polls every 10 seconds regardless of whether any runs are actively processing (line 68). This creates unnecessary load when all runs are completed.

**Affected Components:**
- `innovation-web/lib/use-runs.ts` (lines 59-75)
- Backend API `/api/runs` (receives unnecessary requests)

**Current Behavior:**
```typescript
// Line 68 - Polls unconditionally
const interval = setInterval(fetchRuns, pollingInterval)
```

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Preventive Actions:**
1. **Implement smart polling** - Only poll when processing runs exist
   ```typescript
   const hasProcessingRuns = runs.some(r => r.status === 'PROCESSING')
   if (hasProcessingRuns) {
     interval = setInterval(fetchRuns, pollingInterval)
   }
   ```

2. **Add exponential backoff** - Reduce frequency if no status changes
   ```typescript
   if (noChangesCount > 3) {
     pollingInterval = Math.min(pollingInterval * 1.5, 60000) // Max 1 min
   }
   ```

3. **Use WebSocket for real-time updates** (future enhancement)
   - Replace polling with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
   - Only push updates when pipeline status changes

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Performance test:** Measure API call frequency over 10 minutes
- **Behavior test:** Verify polling stops when no processing runs
- **Edge case test:** Ensure polling resumes if new run starts

**Residual Risk:**
Low - Current 10-second interval is acceptable for MVP. Optimize in v2.

**Owner:** Dev Team
**Timeline:** Acceptable for launch - optimize post-MVP based on usage metrics

### SEC-001: Potential User Data Enumeration

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Low (1) - Requires specific attack attempt
**Impact:** High (3) - Could expose other users' run data

**Description:**
The API route relies solely on Clerk's `userId` from `auth()` to filter runs (line 33). If Clerk token is compromised or auth middleware bypassed, attackers could access other users' pipeline data.

**Affected Components:**
- `innovation-web/app/api/runs/route.ts` (lines 31-40)
- All routes using Clerk authentication

**Current Security:**
```typescript
// Line 33 - Sole defense is Clerk auth
const { userId } = await auth()
if (!userId) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 })
}
```

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Detective/Preventive Actions:**
1. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent brute force enumeration
   ```typescript
   import { ratelimit } from '@/lib/ratelimit'
   const { success } = await ratelimit.limit(userId)
   if (!success) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Too many requests' }, { status: 429 })
   ```

2. **Implement request logging** - Detect suspicious patterns
   ```typescript
   console.log(`[API /runs] User ${userId} fetched page ${page}`)
   ```

3. **Add CSRF protection** - Prevent cross-site attacks
   - Already handled by Next.js App Router (same-origin policy)
   - Verify in security audit

4. **Database-level validation** (when Prisma integrated)
   ```sql
   -- Add index for fast user filtering
   CREATE INDEX idx_runs_userId_createdAt ON pipeline_runs(userId, createdAt DESC);
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Security test:** Attempt to access `/api/runs` with invalid/expired tokens
- **Penetration test:** Try user ID manipulation in requests
- **Rate limit test:** Verify throttling after N requests/minute

**Residual Risk:**
Low - Clerk handles token validation robustly. Additional layers provide defense-in-depth.

**Owner:** Security Review
**Timeline:** Before production launch - Add rate limiting in Sprint 2

### OPS-001: Insufficient Error Handling for Blob Storage

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Vercel Blob occasionally has latency/errors
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Users see generic error, can't diagnose issue

**Description:**
The API route catches all errors generically (line 118-122) without distinguishing between auth failures, Blob API errors, parsing errors, or network issues. This makes debugging production issues difficult.

**Affected Components:**
- `innovation-web/app/api/runs/route.ts` (lines 30-124)
- Error handling in `useRuns.ts` (lines 51-56)

**Current Error Handling:**
```typescript
// Lines 118-122 - Loses error context
catch (error) {
  console.error('[API /runs] Unexpected error:', error)
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 })
}
```

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Corrective Actions:**
1. **Add granular error handling**
   ```typescript
   try {
     const { blobs } = await list({ prefix: `${userId}/` })
   } catch (error) {
     if (error.code === 'BLOB_STORAGE_UNAVAILABLE') {
       return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Storage temporarily unavailable' }, { status: 503 })
     }
     throw error // Re-throw for generic handler
   }
   ```

2. **Implement error monitoring** (e.g., Sentry)
   ```typescript
   import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'
   Sentry.captureException(error, { tags: { route: '/api/runs' } })
   ```

3. **Add client-side retry logic**
   ```typescript
   // In useRuns.ts
   const fetchWithRetry = async (retries = 3) => {
     for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
       try {
         return await fetchRuns()
       } catch (error) {
         if (i === retries - 1) throw error
         await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (i + 1)))
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Surface actionable errors to users**
   ```typescript
   // Show "Storage unavailable - Retrying..." instead of generic error
   ```

**Testing Requirements:**
- **Chaos test:** Simulate Blob API failures, verify graceful degradation
- **Network test:** Test with throttled/dropped connections
- **User experience test:** Verify error messages are actionable

**Residual Risk:**
Low - Errors will still occur, but users will have better visibility and automatic recovery.

**Owner:** Dev Team
**Timeline:** Before production launch - Add in Sprint 1 polish phase

---

## Low Risks (Score 2-3)

### PERF-002: N+1 Query Pattern in Blob Listing

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low (1) - Only triggers with 1000+ user files
**Impact:** High (3) - Could cause timeout for power users

**Description:**
The API fetches all user blobs (limit: 1000) and filters in memory (lines 56-102). For users with hundreds of uploads, this creates unnecessary data transfer and processing.

**Mitigation:**
- **Future optimization:** When database integrated, use SQL `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`
- **Workaround:** Vercel Blob's 1000-item limit is acceptable for MVP
- **Monitoring:** Track API response times; optimize if p95 > 500ms

**Timeline:** Monitor post-launch; optimize if metrics indicate issue

---

### BUS-001: Misleading UI During Database Migration Period

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability:** High (3) - Guaranteed during MVP phase
**Impact:** Low (1) - User confusion, but no data loss

**Description:**
Sidebar shows all runs as "Completed" with 0 cards during MVP phase (before database integration). Users may think feature is broken.

**Mitigation:**
- **Communication:** Add tooltip explaining "Full status tracking coming soon"
- **UI update:** Show "✓ Uploaded" instead of "✅ Completed" to avoid confusion
- **Documentation:** Mention limitation in release notes

**Timeline:** Acceptable for MVP; resolved automatically when Story 7.7 completes

---

### TECH-001: Tight Coupling Between Sidebar and Polling Hook

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability:** Low (1) - Only problematic if requirements change
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Difficult to reuse hook in other components

**Description:**
`useRuns.ts` is tightly coupled to sidebar's 5-run limit and 10-second polling (lines 24-26). Reusing in `/runs` page (full history) requires duplicate logic.

**Mitigation:**
- **Acceptable for now:** Hook is well-tested and functional
- **Future refactor:** Extract into `useRunsQuery(options)` when `/runs` page is built
- **Not blocking:** Current implementation meets all acceptance criteria

**Timeline:** Defer to Story 7.2 (Run History Page) implementation

---

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (DATA-001)

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
1. **Database integration test** (when 7.7 completes)
   - Given: Pipeline run is created with status PROCESSING
   - When: API endpoint is called
   - Then: Sidebar displays PROCESSING with spinner icon

2. **Status transition test**
   - Given: Run is PROCESSING
   - When: Pipeline completes
   - Then: Status updates to COMPLETED within 10 seconds (1 polling cycle)

3. **Multi-status test**
   - Given: User has 3 COMPLETED, 1 PROCESSING, 1 FAILED runs
   - When: Sidebar loads
   - Then: Each displays correct status badge

**Required Test Data:**
- Mock database with runs in all 4 states (PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED, CANCELLED)
- User with 10+ runs to test pagination
- User with 0 runs to test empty state

---

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests (PERF-001, SEC-001, OPS-001)

**Performance Tests:**
1. Measure API response time with 100, 500, 1000 blobs
2. Verify polling doesn't trigger when `shouldPoll = false` (line 25)
3. Test memory usage during 10-minute polling session

**Security Tests:**
1. Attempt API access with expired JWT token (expect 401)
2. Try accessing `/api/runs` from different domain (CORS test)
3. Verify rate limiting prevents >60 requests/minute (when implemented)

**Operational Tests:**
1. Simulate Vercel Blob API timeout → verify error message displayed
2. Test network interruption during polling → verify recovery
3. Verify error logs contain sufficient debugging information

---

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests (Regression Suite)

**Standard Functional Tests:**
- ✅ All 20 unit tests already passing (as noted in story)
- ✅ Responsive design tested (mobile collapse works)
- ✅ Navigation handlers tested (click to `/runs/[runId]`)
- ✅ Loading skeleton displays correctly

**Additional Regression Tests:**
- Verify existing sidebar functionality unchanged (home button, user button)
- Test keyboard navigation (tab through run items)
- Verify accessibility (screen reader announces status changes)

---

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

**Performance Metrics:**
- API response time (`/api/runs`): p50, p95, p99
- Polling frequency: Requests per minute per user
- Sidebar render time: Time to interactive (TTI)

**Alerts to Configure:**
- `/api/runs` error rate >5% over 5 minutes → PagerDuty
- API response time p95 >1000ms → Slack notification
- Vercel Blob API errors >10/hour → Email alert

**Business KPIs:**
- Sidebar engagement: % users clicking run items
- Feature adoption: % authenticated users viewing sidebar
- Error experience: % sessions encountering API errors

**Dashboard Requirements:**
- Real-time API health (response times, error rates)
- User engagement metrics (click-through rates)
- System load (polling requests/second)

---

## Risk Review Triggers

**Review and update risk profile when:**

1. **Story 7.7 (Prisma Database) is completed**
   - Re-assess DATA-001 (should drop from High to Minimal)
   - Validate database query performance
   - Update testing strategy for integration tests

2. **Story 7.2 (Run History Page) is implemented**
   - Re-evaluate TECH-001 (coupling risk)
   - Assess if hook refactoring is needed

3. **Production metrics indicate issues**
   - API p95 latency exceeds 500ms
   - Error rate exceeds 2%
   - User complaints about stale data

4. **Security audit findings**
   - If penetration test reveals auth bypass
   - If rate limiting proves insufficient

5. **Regulatory requirements change**
   - GDPR/privacy considerations for run data
   - Data retention policies for pipeline history

**Story 7.1 Score: 78/100 (Low-Medium Risk)**

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Must Fix (Before Production)
✅ **None blocking** - Feature is deployable with current implementation

### Should Fix (Sprint 2 - High Value)
1. **Integrate database for real status tracking** (DATA-001) - Blocked by 7.7
2. **Add rate limiting for security** (SEC-001) - 2-hour task
3. **Implement smart polling** (PERF-001) - 4-hour task

### Nice to Have (Monitor and Optimize)
1. Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages (OPS-001)
2. Exponential backoff for polling when no changes detected (PERF-001)
3. WebSocket/SSE for real-time updates (future enhancement)

### Technical Debt to Track
1. Refactor `useRuns` hook for reusability (TECH-001) - Address in Story 7.2
2. Replace in-memory blob filtering with SQL queries (PERF-002) - Automatic with 7.7

## Quality Gate Integration

Based on risk profile, **deterministic gate decision:**

**Gate Mapping Logic:**
- Any risk score ≥ 9 → FAIL (unless waived)
- Any risk score ≥ 6 → CONCERNS
- All risks < 6 → PASS

**Identified Risks:**
- Highest risk: DATA-001 (score 6)
- Result: **Gate = CONCERNS**

**Unmitigated Risks:**
- DATA-001: Database integration incomplete (blocked by Story 7.7)

**Waiver Recommendation:**
- **Can waive for MVP launch** if:
  1. Disclaimer tooltip added to UI ("Full status tracking coming soon")
  2. Story 7.7 scheduled for Sprint 2 (within 2 weeks)
  3. Product Owner accepts temporary limitation
