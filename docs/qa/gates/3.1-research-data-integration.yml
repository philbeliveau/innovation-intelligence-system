  lines_of_code: ~130
  test_coverage: "Comprehensive (all ACs validated)"
  documentation: "Excellent (comprehensive with examples)"

# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  Excellent implementation demonstrating software engineering best practices:

  Strengths:
  - Clean, maintainable code with proper type hints and docstrings
  - Robust error handling with non-fatal failures
  - Comprehensive test coverage validating all acceptance criteria
  - Detailed documentation with usage examples
  - Appropriate logging for observability
  - UTF-8 encoding explicitly specified

  Fixed During Review:
  - Test script section marker bug (now correctly validates 8/8 sections)

  Future Enhancements (non-blocking):
  - Pytest integration for automated testing
  - Caching if research data reused in same pipeline run
  - File size validation in test script

  Decision: PASS - Production ready
