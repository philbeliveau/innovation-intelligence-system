# Deployment safety checklist
deployment:
  feature_flag: IMPLEMENTED
  flag_name: "NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_PIPELINE_UI"
  rollback_plan: DOCUMENTED
  safety_rating: EXCELLENT
  notes: "Feature flag allows instant rollback without code changes"

# Technical debt assessment
technical_debt:
  added: NONE
  removed: NONE
  net_impact: NEUTRAL
  notes: "Implementation adds zero technical debt. Minor ESLint warnings in test files (-5 points from quality score)."

# Final summary
summary: |
  Story 8.1 is production-ready with excellent implementation quality.

  STRENGTHS:
  - All 7 acceptance criteria fully satisfied
  - Comprehensive test coverage (27 tests across 2 files)
  - Zero `any` types in implementation code
  - Feature flag pattern enables safe deployment
  - Clean component architecture
  - Zero technical debt added

  DEPLOYMENT PATH:
  1. Merge to main branch
  2. Deploy with flag OFF (NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_PIPELINE_UI=false)
  3. Verify existing pipeline functionality unchanged
  4. Enable flag (NEXT_PUBLIC_NEW_PIPELINE_UI=true)
  5. Monitor production for issues
  6. Remove flag in future cleanup story once stable

  GATE DECISION: PASS âœ…
