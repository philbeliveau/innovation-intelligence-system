nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Environment variables properly validated, no hardcoded secrets, no injection vulnerabilities, proper input validation and encoding"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Appropriate token limits (3500), efficient file I/O, temperature 0.5 suitable for synthesis, structured logging won't impact performance"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Comprehensive input validation and error handling, but zero automated tests for regression prevention. Manual test execution unverified."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code quality with complete type hints and docstrings, follows all coding standards (PEP 8), clean architecture consistent with Stages 1 & 2. Prompt template is long (114 lines) but well-structured."
