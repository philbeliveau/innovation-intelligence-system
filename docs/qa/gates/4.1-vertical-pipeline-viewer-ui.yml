gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation complete with high quality, but missing automated tests and has 3 reliability concerns that should be monitored in production"

top_issues:
  - id: "REL-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Hardcoded project root path assumption (join(process.cwd(), '..')) in API route is fragile across deployment environments"
    suggested_action: "Use environment variable for data directory path or resolve dynamically based on Vercel deployment structure"
  - id: "REL-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No exponential backoff for retry logic - single retry with fixed 5s delay may not handle sustained network issues"
    suggested_action: "Implement exponential backoff: retry at 5s, 10s, 20s before giving up"
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No automated test coverage - only manual testing documented (acceptable for hackathon MVP but risky for production)"
    suggested_action: "Add unit tests for calculateStageStatus() and integration tests for polling lifecycle before production deployment"

    monitor:
      - "Monitor API route failures in production logs for path resolution issues"
      - "Track polling retry patterns to validate single-retry sufficiency"
      - "Manual regression testing required before each deployment until automated tests are added"

  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Input sanitization, XSS protection, path traversal prevention all implemented correctly"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "5-second polling interval reasonable, cleanup prevents memory leaks, no performance bottlenecks identified"
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Hardcoded path assumptions, missing exponential backoff, single retry may be insufficient for production"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure, TypeScript strict typing, JSDoc comments, follows coding standards"
