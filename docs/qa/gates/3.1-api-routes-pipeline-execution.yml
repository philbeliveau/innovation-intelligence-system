    notes: "Command injection fixed during review. Missing CSRF protection and automated security tests. Input sanitization good."

    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "No concurrency limits. Synchronous blob download acceptable for MVP. Polling-based status adequate."

    status: FAIL
    notes: "CRITICAL: Serverless architecture will not support long-running subprocess execution in production. Works locally but will fail on Vercel."

    notes: "Clean code structure, good separation of concerns, consistent error handling. Minor issues with hardcoded paths."

# Detailed recommendations by priority
recommendations:
  immediate:  # Must fix before production
    - action: "Make architectural decision on deployment platform or Python execution strategy"
      refs: ["docs/architecture/deployment.md"]
      rationale: "Current design incompatible with stated Vercel deployment target"

    - action: "Verify Story 3.2 (Python CLI modifications) complete and test backward compatibility"
      refs: ["scripts/run_pipeline.py", "docs/stories/3.2-python-pipeline-modifications.md"]
      rationale: "Dependency not verified - AC 11 cannot be validated"

    - action: "Add automated test suite with minimum P0 coverage (security validation)"
      refs: ["innovation-web/__tests__/api/"]
      rationale: "Zero test coverage is unacceptable for security-sensitive endpoints"

  future:  # Can be addressed in follow-up stories
    - action: "Resolve data directory duplication - standardize brand profiles location"
      refs: ["data/brand-profiles/", "innovation-web/data/brand-profiles/"]
      rationale: "Violates DRY principle and causes path resolution inconsistencies"

    - action: "Extract path resolution to centralized configuration module"
      refs: ["app/api/run/route.ts:81", "app/api/status/[runId]/route.ts:70"]
      rationale: "Hardcoded join(process.cwd(), '..') violates portability"

    - action: "Add CSRF protection for state-changing operations"
      refs: ["app/api/run/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Defense-in-depth security measure"

    - action: "Implement pipeline execution queue or concurrency limits"
      refs: ["app/api/run/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Prevent resource exhaustion from concurrent runs"
