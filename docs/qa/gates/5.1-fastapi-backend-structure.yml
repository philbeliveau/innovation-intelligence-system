top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "CORS wildcard pattern 'https://*.vercel.app' is not valid - CORS spec does not support wildcard subdomains"

    status: fixed
  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No automated testing framework configured (pytest, unit tests)"

  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Four __pycache__ directories tracked in git (backend/app, backend/pipeline, backend/pipeline/stages, backend/pipeline/prompts)"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "CORS wildcard pattern was invalid (FIXED). Need to verify environment-based CORS in deployment. No rate limiting yet (acceptable for MVP)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Minimal FastAPI app with appropriate dependencies. No performance concerns for infrastructure setup."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Health check endpoint functional. Error handling is placeholder (acceptable per AC)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean directory structure, well-documented README, comprehensive .env.example. Code is <200 lines as required."

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Verify ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable works correctly in Railway deployment"
      refs: ["backend/app/main.py:20-29", "backend/.env.example:13-15"]
    - action: "Remove __pycache__ directories from git and verify .gitignore coverage"
      refs: ["backend/app/__pycache__/", "backend/pipeline/**/__pycache__/"]
  future:
    - action: "Add pytest configuration with basic health endpoint tests before Story 5.4"
      refs: ["backend/requirements.txt", "backend/tests/ (create)"]
    - action: "Consider adding request logging middleware for debugging"
      refs: ["backend/app/main.py"]
    - action: "Add API versioning to routes (e.g., /api/v1/run) for future compatibility"
      refs: ["backend/app/routes.py"]

refactoring_performed:
  - file: "backend/app/main.py"
    change: "Fixed CORS configuration - removed invalid wildcard pattern, added environment-based origin support"
    why: "CORS spec does not support subdomain wildcards like 'https://*.vercel.app' - would cause runtime errors"
    how: "Replaced with explicit origins list + ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable for dynamic preview deployments"
  - file: "backend/app/main.py"
    change: "Moved import os to top of file (PEP 8 compliance)"
    why: "Standard library imports should appear at the top of the file per Python style guidelines"
    how: "Relocated import statement from line 19 to line 6"
  - file: "backend/.env.example"
    change: "Added ALLOWED_ORIGINS configuration with documentation"
    why: "New environment variable needed for CORS configuration wasn't documented in template"
    how: "Added commented section explaining comma-separated origin list for Vercel previews"
