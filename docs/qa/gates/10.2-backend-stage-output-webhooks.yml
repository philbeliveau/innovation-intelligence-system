# Quality Gate: Story 10.2 - Backend Stage Output Webhooks
schema: 1
story: "10.2"
story_title: "backend-stage-output-webhooks"
gate: PASS
status_reason: "All 10 acceptance criteria met with comprehensive test coverage (10 passing tests), excellent code quality following Python best practices, robust error handling with exponential backoff retry logic, and production-ready implementation. No issues identified."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Webhook authentication via X-Webhook-Secret header. Environment validation present. Minor suggestion: consider HMAC signatures for production scale (non-blocking)."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Non-blocking async design with 10s timeout and exponential backoff. Expected avg delivery < 500ms. Max retry delay ~7s."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust retry logic (3 attempts), graceful degradation (failures don't block pipeline), comprehensive error logging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear code structure, excellent docstrings, separation of concerns (async core + sync wrapper), comprehensive test coverage."
