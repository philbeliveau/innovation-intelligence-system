# Quality Gate Decision - Story 10.6
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "10.6"
story_title: "download-report-api-endpoint"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Implementation is production-ready with excellent API route test coverage (16/16 passing). Two concerns: (1) PDF generator unit tests fail due to jsdom/jsPDF/html2canvas incompatibility - this is a tooling limitation, not a code defect; (2) Missing rate limiting and authentication checks could enable abuse. Recommend addressing security concerns before production release."

  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "HTML escaping and filename sanitization implemented correctly. Missing rate limiting and authentication checks. Recommend adding before production."
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "10-second timeout protection implemented and tested. No caching strategy. Consider monitoring production performance and adding cache for frequently accessed reports."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling (404, 500, 503). Graceful degradation for missing data. Timeout protection prevents hanging requests."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure with separation of concerns. Well-typed with TypeScript. Good inline documentation."
