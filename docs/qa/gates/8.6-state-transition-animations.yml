  - id: "TEST-002"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Existing state-machine tests failing (3/15 passing) due to animation wrapper additions - test suite needs updating"

# Implementation strengths
strengths:
  - "GPU-accelerated animations using transform/opacity only (no layout thrashing)"
  - "Comprehensive reduced motion support with color pulse fallback"
  - "Excellent accessibility: StateAnnouncer with aria-live regions"
  - "Clean architecture: reusable transition components with proper separation"
  - "Performance utilities: FPS monitoring, CLS measurement, will-change management"
  - "Well-documented code with JSDoc comments and usage examples"
  - "Proper TypeScript typing throughout animation system"
  - "Stagger animation with sensible caps (maxStagger: 6)"
  - "Integration with existing pipeline components (CollapsedSidebar, SparksGrid, PipelineStateMachine)"

# Areas requiring improvement
improvement_areas:
  - "Performance testing infrastructure (AC#7) not implemented"
  - "State-machine tests broken by animation additions"
  - "Pre-existing TypeScript issues carried forward"
  - "No Playwright E2E tests for cross-browser validation"
  - "Missing performance budgets in CI/CD"
