# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Webhook authentication via X-Webhook-Secret properly implemented. Zod validation prevents injection attacks. No sensitive data logged. Prisma ORM provides SQL injection protection."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Dual persistence strategy improves status endpoint performance. Bulk insert for opportunity cards. Non-blocking JSON saves prevent timeouts. Expected webhook response time: 50-200ms."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Non-blocking error handling ensures pipeline continues even if JSON save fails. Idempotency check prevents duplicate processing. Backward compatibility preserved for old pipelines."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code structure. Well-documented critical sections. Type-safe Zod schemas. Comprehensive test coverage. Follows all coding standards."

# Detailed Test Coverage

# Recommendations for Future Work (Non-Blocking)
recommendations:
  immediate: []
  future:
    - action: "Add full HTTP integration tests with mocked Railway backend"
      priority: low
      refs: ["innovation-web/__tests__/api/pipeline/"]
      rationale: "Data layer tests are sufficient for current needs, but full HTTP tests would provide additional confidence"
    - action: "Consider rate limiting for webhook endpoints"
      priority: low
      refs: ["innovation-web/app/api/pipeline/[runId]/stage-update/route.ts", "innovation-web/app/api/pipeline/[runId]/complete/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Defense-in-depth security enhancement, not critical for internal Railway-to-Vercel communication"
    - action: "Add structured logging with correlation IDs"
      priority: low
      refs: ["innovation-web/app/api/pipeline/[runId]/stage-update/route.ts", "innovation-web/app/api/pipeline/[runId]/complete/route.ts"]
      rationale: "Would make debugging across webhook calls easier, but current logging is adequate"
