# Non-Functional Requirements Validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Uses yaml.safe_load() for safe YAML parsing. No sensitive data. File paths properly validated."

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test execution <1 second for all 4 profiles. YAML files are small (1-2KB). No performance concerns."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling. All tests pass consistently. Early termination on validation errors."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Enhanced with logging, pytest compatibility, and improved documentation during review. PROJECT_ROOT pattern used for paths."
