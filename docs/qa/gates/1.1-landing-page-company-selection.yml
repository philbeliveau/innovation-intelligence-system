# Additional notes
notes: |
  This implementation is production-ready for MVP/demo purposes. The developer (James)
  demonstrated excellent craftsmanship with clean code, proper TypeScript usage, and full
  accessibility compliance. Visual design matches reference image at 95%+ similarity.

  The only modification made during QA review was updating a deprecated React event handler
  (onKeyPress → onKeyDown), which is a best practice for React 19 compatibility.

  Technical debt items identified are low-impact and appropriate for a hackathon MVP.
  None block production release for demo/validation purposes.

  Recommended next steps:
  1. Developer updates File List section with QA modification
  2. Mark story as "Done"
  3. Proceed to next priority story (1.2 or 1.3)
