# Frontend Migration to Railway Backend

schema: 1
story: "5.3"

    notes: "Input sanitization robust. Error message leakage fixed by QA. Authentication present. No hardcoded secrets. Score: 95/100"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Retry logic with exponential backoff. 30s timeout appropriate. Hardcoded constants acceptable for MVP. Score: 90/100"

    changes:
      - "Added error message sanitization in runPipeline (lines 120-124)"
      - "Added error message sanitization in getStatus (lines 160-163)"
    reason: "Security: Prevent internal implementation leakage via error messages"
    impact: "Generic messages for 5xx errors, specific messages for 4xx errors"

# Compliance checklist
compliance:
  coding_standards: PASS
  project_structure: PASS
  testing_strategy: FAIL  # Zero automated tests
  all_acs_met: PARTIAL  # 8/10 (AC8-9 blocked by Story 5.4)

# Recommended path forward
decision_options:
  option_a:
    name: "Add tests before merge (RECOMMENDED)"
    risk: "LOW"
    effort: "5-7 hours"
    steps:
      - "Dev creates lib/backend-client.test.ts"
      - "Dev creates integration tests for API routes"
      - "Run npm test to verify"
      - "Re-run QA review (fast pass)"
      - "Mark story as Done"

  option_b:
    name: "Document as tech debt (ACCEPTABLE)"
    risk: "MEDIUM"
    effort: "1 hour (create follow-up story)"
    steps:
      - "Create Story 5.3.1: Add Backend Client Tests"
      - "Prioritize in next sprint"
      - "Mark current story as Done with Tech Debt"
      - "Update this gate file with waiver"

  option_c:
    name: "Ship without tests (NOT RECOMMENDED)"
    risk: "HIGH"
    effort: "0 hours"
    steps:
      - "Merge to main without tests"
      - "Accept increased regression risk"
      - "Violates testing strategy standards"

  recommended: "option_b"
  rationale: "Given external dependency on Story 5.4, Option B (tech debt story) is pragmatic for MVP timeline. Tests MUST be added before production launch."
