# Quality Gate Decision - Story 2.4
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "2.4"
story_title: "Stages 1-3 Integration Testing and Refinement"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Strong technical foundation with excellent code quality (90/100), but critical validation and refinement work remains incomplete. Only 3 of 8 acceptance criteria fully met (37.5%). Must complete manual quality review and iterative refinement cycle before marking Done."

# Issues identified
top_issues:
  - id: "AC-004"
    severity: high
    finding: "Manual quality review not completed (AC 4) - checklist exists but systematic review of 6 outputs not performed"
    suggested_action: "Perform comprehensive manual quality review using docs/stage-1-3-quality-checklist.md on all 6 test outputs. Score each stage (1-2-3) for each input and document findings."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "AC-005"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Prompt refinement iteration not performed (AC 5) - current prompts are v1.0 baseline without quality-driven refinement"
    suggested_action: "Based on AC 4 quality review findings, refine prompts in pipeline/prompts/ to address quality issues. Document changes and rationale."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "AC-006"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Re-test after prompt refinement not executed (AC 6) - only initial test run completed"
    suggested_action: "After AC 5 prompt refinement, re-run python test_stages_1_3.py, perform second quality review, and compare results to validate improvements."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "AC-008"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Success metric validation not performed (AC 8) - cannot verify 80% quality target without AC 4 review"
    suggested_action: "After AC 6 re-test, validate that 4 out of 5 inputs (80%) achieve 'Pass' rating. Document results in story or test summary."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "AC-007"
    severity: low
    finding: "Prompt design rationale documentation incomplete (AC 7) - prompts have docstrings but no explicit rationale for key instructions"
    suggested_action: "Create docs/prompt-design-rationale.md explaining: why 3-5 inspirations limit, why anti-hallucination emphasis, why de-contextualization requirement, output format choices, temperature/max_tokens justification."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "CONSISTENCY-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Success metric inconsistency - checklist says 67% (4/6), AC 8 says 80% (4/5), test processed 6 inputs"
    suggested_action: "Clarify whether success target is 67% or 80% and update consistently across story, checklist, and test summary."

    notes: "API keys properly managed via environment variables, no hardcoded credentials, proper file path validation, no injection vulnerabilities"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Test duration 5.8 minutes for 6 inputs (~58s/input) is acceptable for offline batch processing. Performance dominated by LLM API calls (expected)."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code structure, follows PEP 8 and coding standards, good docstrings, clear separation of concerns. Minor: add more type hints (currently ~70% coverage)"

# Technical debt identified
technical_debt:
  - item: "Manual quality review workflow not executed (blocks AC 4, 5, 6, 8)"
    severity: high
    impact: "Cannot validate if pipeline produces quality outputs or complete story"

  - item: "Iterative refinement cycle not completed (blocks AC 5, 6)"
    severity: medium
    impact: "Prompts remain at v1.0 baseline without quality-driven improvements"

  - item: "Prompt design rationale documentation missing (AC 7 partial)"
    severity: low
    impact: "Future developers lack context for prompt design decisions"

  - item: "Type hint coverage ~70% (not 100%)"
    severity: low

# Gate decision rationale
decision_rationale: |
  GATE: CONCERNS (not FAIL) because:

  ✅ STRENGTHS:
  - Excellent technical foundation (code quality: 90/100)
  - All completed work is production-ready
  - Test infrastructure is comprehensive and well-designed
  - No blocking technical issues or architectural concerns
  - Security, performance, reliability, maintainability all PASS

  ⚠️ CONCERNS:
  - Story represents multi-phase iterative workflow (4 phases)
  - Only Phase 1 complete (infrastructure building)
  - Phases 2-4 not started (validation, refinement, documentation)
  - 5 of 8 acceptance criteria not met or partially met
  - Cannot validate core success metric (80% quality) without manual review

  DECISION: CONCERNS (not FAIL) because the work that IS complete demonstrates
  excellent engineering quality. The remaining work is clearly scoped, well-defined,
  and procedural. No rework needed—just completion of planned phases.

  Story should be marked "In Progress" (not "Approved") until all 8 ACs are met.
  The distinction between "foundation complete" and "story complete" must be clear.

  Estimated 4-6 hours to complete remaining work:
  - 2 hours: Manual quality review (AC 4)
  - 1-2 hours: Prompt refinement (AC 5)
  - 1 hour: Re-test and comparison (AC 6)
  - 1 hour: Documentation and metric validation (AC 7, 8)

# Next actions for story owner
next_actions:
  - action: "Update story status from 'Approved' to 'In Progress'"
    rationale: "Story is not complete - only 3/8 ACs fully met"

  - action: "Begin AC 4: Manual quality review using checklist on all 6 outputs"
    rationale: "Critical path dependency - blocks ACs 5, 6, 8"

  - action: "After AC 4: Implement prompt refinements based on findings (AC 5)"
    rationale: "Quality-driven improvement iteration"

  - action: "After AC 5: Re-run test and validate improvements (AC 6)"
    rationale: "Verify refinements improved output quality"

  - action: "Complete AC 7: Document prompt design rationale"
    rationale: "Preserve design decisions for future maintenance"

  - action: "Validate AC 8: Confirm 80% success metric achieved"
    rationale: "Final acceptance criteria validation"

  - action: "After all ACs met: Update story status to 'Done'"
    rationale: "Only mark Done when all acceptance criteria fully met"
