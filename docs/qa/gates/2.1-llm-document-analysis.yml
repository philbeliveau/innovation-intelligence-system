# Code quality highlights
strengths:
  - "Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes (400, 500)"
  - "Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures"
  - "Graceful LLM response parsing with fallback values on parse failure"
  - "Excellent logging at each stage for debugging (download, extract, analyze, respond)"
  - "Environment variable validation on startup prevents missing key errors"
  - "Markdown code block stripping for robust JSON parsing from LLM"
  - "Clear separation of concerns with sequential flow (download → extract → analyze → respond)"
  - "User-friendly error messages (technical details only in logs, not exposed to client)"
  - "Full compliance with coding standards (Next.js 15 patterns, TypeScript strict, proper imports)"

# Review notes
notes: |
  This is excellent implementation work. The code demonstrates strong engineering practices,
  comprehensive error handling, clear organization, and full adherence to project standards.

  The LLM integration is robust with proper retry logic, fallback handling, and defensive
  JSON parsing. Security posture is appropriate for MVP scope with low-risk vectors properly
  mitigated. Performance design meets requirements with appropriate timeout and retry configuration.

  All 10 acceptance criteria have been implemented with code-level validation. The only gap
  is procedural: manual testing (Task 9) hasn't been executed yet, which is required per AC 10
  before the story can move to "Done" status.

  No code changes recommended. The implementation is production-ready. Gate status is CONCERNS
  solely due to pending test validation, not code defects. Once Task 9 passes, update this
  gate to PASS and move the story to "Done".

  Quality score of 85/100 reflects excellent implementation quality with deductions only for
  incomplete validation process (not code quality issues).
