# Quality Gate Decision for Story 1.3

# Required fields
schema: 1
story: "1.3"
story_title: "Upload Page UI with Company Badge"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "All critical issues resolved during QA review. Path traversal vulnerability fixed with input sanitization, js-yaml dependency aligned with TypeScript types, and keyboard accessibility implemented. Test coverage remains low but acceptable for hackathon scope."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
updated: "2025-10-19T20:00:00Z"

# Always present but only active when WAIVED
waiver: { active: false }

# Issues identified (RESOLVED during QA review)
top_issues:
  - id: "DEP-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Using 'yaml' package instead of 'js-yaml' (TypeScript types reference @types/js-yaml but runtime uses different package)"
    suggested_action: "RESOLVED: Changed all imports from 'yaml' to 'js-yaml' and updated package.json. Both route files now use js-yaml consistently."
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "RESOLVED"

  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Path traversal vulnerability in route.ts:20 - company_id from cookie is directly concatenated into file path without validation"
    suggested_action: "RESOLVED: Added input sanitization in current-company/route.ts (lines 19-27) with regex validation and 400 error on invalid characters."
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "RESOLVED"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Zero test coverage for Story 1.3 - no unit, integration, or E2E tests present"
    suggested_action: "DEFERRED: Acceptable for hackathon scope. Recommend adding test coverage before production deployment."
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "DEFERRED"

  - id: "ERROR-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Error handling in upload page (page.tsx:98-114) uses string matching on error messages which is fragile"
    suggested_action: "DEFERRED: Works correctly for current scope. Consider structured error codes in future iteration."
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "DEFERRED"

  - id: "A11Y-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "Upload zone keyboard interaction (page.tsx:160, tabIndex={0}) doesn't implement Enter/Space key handlers as required by AC 42"
    suggested_action: "RESOLVED: Added handleKeyDown function (lines 132-139) with Enter/Space key handling. Updated dropzone config with noClick option and explicit onClick/onKeyDown handlers."
    suggested_owner: "dev"
    status: "RESOLVED"

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Path traversal vulnerability RESOLVED with input sanitization (route.ts:19-27). Cookie-based auth is appropriate. No XSS vulnerabilities detected. CSRF protection via Next.js defaults."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Build passes in 717ms. File upload uses simulated progress (acceptable for hackathon). No performance bottlenecks detected. Static rendering where possible (page is client component by necessity)."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages. Network errors, file type validation, and size limits properly handled. Graceful degradation on missing cookie (silent redirect)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Code is clean and well-structured. Dependency mismatch RESOLVED (js-yaml aligned). Missing tests acceptable for hackathon scope. Error handling works correctly though could be enhanced with error codes in future."
