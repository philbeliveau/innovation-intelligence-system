# Critical Issues Identified
top_issues:
  - id: "RACE-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "Race condition in pipeline startup - First status poll returns 404 before log file exists"
    impact: "PipelineViewer polls /api/status/{runId} immediately after /api/run returns, but Python pipeline hasn't created log file yet. Causes initial 404 error (recovers after 5s retry)."
    suggested_action: "Add 2-3 second initial delay before first status poll in PipelineViewer useEffect, or implement exponential backoff starting at 404"

    finding: "Missing error recovery UI for Task 7 (AC 7)"
    impact: "Error handling callback implemented but retry UI with 'Retry Pipeline' and 'Return to Upload' buttons not rendered in analyze page"

# Gate Decision Rationale
decision_rationale: |
  GATE: CONCERNS (not PASS, not FAIL)

  **Why CONCERNS instead of PASS:**
  - AC 7 (Error Recovery UI) is incomplete - error callback works but UI not rendered
  - Race condition causes user-visible 404 error on initial poll (recovers after 5s)
  - Buffer deprecation warning should be clean for production

  **Why CONCERNS instead of FAIL:**
  - Core functionality works end-to-end (9 of 10 ACs passing)
  - Pipeline executes successfully, inline rendering works, animation smooth
  - Issues are non-blocking and fixable in < 2 hours total
  - No security vulnerabilities or data loss risks
  - Performance is excellent (0KB bundle impact)

  **Recommendation:**
  Address the 3 immediate issues (2 high priority, 1 low priority) before marking story as Done.
  Total estimated effort: 1.5-2 hours to achieve PASS gate.

  The implementation demonstrates excellent architectural design (reusable components, TypeScript
  strict mode, CSS-only animations) and should not be blocked - just needs polish on error handling.

# Code Quality Highlights
strengths:
  - "Excellent component extraction - PipelineViewer is truly reusable (inline + full-page modes)"
  - "Zero bundle size impact by using CSS transitions instead of Framer Motion"
  - "Proper TypeScript typing throughout with strict mode"
  - "Clean separation of concerns - state management, UI rendering, API calls all separated"
  - "Comprehensive error handling at API level (exponential backoff, timeout detection)"
  - "Backward compatibility maintained - /pipeline/[runId] still works"

# Reviewer Notes
notes: |
  This is solid work that demonstrates strong architectural thinking. The decision to extract
  PipelineViewer as a reusable component with inline/full-page modes shows maturity. The use
  of CSS-only transitions instead of adding Framer Motion shows good bundle-size awareness.

  The race condition is a common issue when coordinating async processes (API response vs file
  creation). The current exponential backoff handles it but adding a small initial delay would
  eliminate the user-visible 404.

  The missing error recovery UI (AC 7) is a straightforward fix - the callback infrastructure
  is there, just need to render the Alert component with action buttons.

  Overall: Strong B+ work that needs 1-2 hours of polish to become A-level.
