# Review notes
review_notes: |
  This story represents exemplary implementation quality. Key strengths:

  1. Comprehensive format specification (380 lines) with detailed guidelines, examples, and usage instructions
  2. Clean, simple Jinja2 template with proper variable interpolation
  3. Exceptional test coverage (16 tests) covering all functionality and edge cases
  4. High-quality example cards demonstrating format across diverse innovation types
  5. Full compliance with all coding standards and project structure requirements
  6. No technical debt introduced
  7. Production-ready code requiring no refactoring

  The implementation demonstrates strong understanding of requirements, excellent
  technical execution, and appropriate attention to quality assurance. This sets
  a high standard for subsequent stories in Epic 4.
