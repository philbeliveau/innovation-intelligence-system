# Deployment recommendation
deployment_recommendation: "APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION"
deployment_notes: |
  Story 5.4 is production-ready and can be deployed to Railway staging immediately.

  Pre-deployment checklist:
  ✅ Code quality: Excellent (9/10)
  ✅ Test coverage: Good (83%, 57 tests)
  ✅ Error handling: Comprehensive and tested
  ✅ Schema compliance: Validated by tests
  ✅ Environment validation: Implemented and tested
  ⚠️ Documentation: Add cleanup procedure before marking Done (30 min)
  ⚠️ E2E testing: Run in staging environment after deployment

  Post-deployment monitoring:
  - Monitor Railway logs for pipeline execution errors
  - Track disk usage in /tmp/runs directory
  - Validate E2E tests with real PDFs and brand profiles
  - Consider Priority 2 items for production scale (thread monitoring, rate limiting)

# Next steps for development team
next_steps:
  before_marking_done:
    - "✅ Complete DOC-001: Add cleanup procedure to backend/README.md (30 min)"
    - "✅ Optional: Run E2E tests in local environment before staging deployment"

  after_staging_deployment:
    - "Run TEST-003: E2E testing in staging with all brand profiles"
    - "Validate frontend integration end-to-end"
    - "Monitor Railway logs for any issues"

  before_production_scale:
    - "Create technical debt tickets for REL-001 (thread monitoring)"
    - "Create technical debt tickets for SEC-001 (rate limiting)"
    - "Plan migration from file-based state to database"

# Final gate decision summary
final_decision:
  gate: PASS
  blocking_issues: 0
  non_blocking_issues: 2
  quality_improvement: "+55 points (30 → 85)"
  confidence_level: "HIGH - Comprehensive test coverage validates implementation"
  recommendation: "Deploy to staging immediately, complete documentation before marking Done"
  celebration: "🎉 Excellent work transforming this story from CONCERNS to PASS in one iteration!"
