    notes: |
      - Uses Clerk's official auth() function correctly
      - Defense in depth: middleware + route-level checks
      - Auth check is first operation in each handler (prevents unauthorized processing)
      - Consistent 401 error handling with user-friendly messages
      - No information leakage in error responses
      - No security vulnerabilities identified
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Minimal overhead (<10ms per request per spec)
      - Non-blocking async/await implementation
      - No N+1 queries or inefficiencies introduced
      - Middleware caching handled by Clerk SDK
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Proper error handling with try-catch blocks
      - Graceful 401 responses for unauthenticated users
      - No breaking changes to existing auth flow
      - Clear error messages for debugging
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      - Clean, consistent code across all 3 API routes
      - Follows Next.js 15 and TypeScript conventions
      - Self-documenting code with clear intent
      - No technical debt introduced

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blocking issues - ready for manual testing
  future:
    - action: "Consider adding authorization (role/permission checks) if multi-tenant or role-based access is needed in future"
      refs: ["innovation-web/app/api/*/route.ts"]
      priority: low
      context: "Current auth-only approach is appropriate for demo scope where all authenticated users have equal access"

# Code quality highlights
quality_highlights:
  - "Consistent authentication pattern across all 3 API routes"
  - "Security-first design with auth check before any request processing"
  - "Defense in depth with both middleware and route-level protection"
  - "Clear, user-friendly error messages without information leakage"
  - "Production-ready code with no refactoring needed"

# Manual testing checklist (to be completed before marking Done)

  - test: "Authenticated user flow: sign in → upload → run pipeline → view results"
    status: pending
    acceptance_criteria: 4
  - test: "Unauthenticated access: verify 401 responses from incognito/API calls"
    status: pending
    acceptance_criteria: 2
  - test: "Regression check: existing demo flow works identically"
    status: pending
    acceptance_criteria: 5
  - test: "Middleware verification: sign-in/sign-up accessible, protected routes blocked"
    status: pending
