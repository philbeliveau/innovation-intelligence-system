# Implementation highlights
implementation_strengths:
  - "Handler clearing pattern prevents duplicate logging (best practice)"
  - "Progressive error context with full file paths enables trivial debugging"
  - "Test isolation with automatic cleanup prevents test pollution"
  - "ISO timestamp format (YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS) ensures sortable directory names"
  - "Forward-looking utility functions (load_brand_profile, load_input_document) support future stories"

# Standards compliance verification
standards_compliance:
  coding_standards: PASS  # Full PEP 8, type hints, docstrings
  project_structure: PASS  # Correct file locations and directory structure
  testing_strategy: PASS  # Comprehensive unit and integration tests
  documentation: PASS  # Complete docstrings with examples

# Recommendations (none for immediate action)
recommendations:
  immediate: []  # No blockers or critical issues
  future: []  # No improvements needed - excellent implementation
