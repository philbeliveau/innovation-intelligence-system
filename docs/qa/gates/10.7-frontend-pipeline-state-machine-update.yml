nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No new security vulnerabilities introduced. Operates within established security boundaries. No sensitive data exposure."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Polling optimized with exponential backoff. Efficient stop condition prevents infinite polling. Mode detection is O(1) complexity. 35-minute timeout provides reasonable upper bound."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Graceful error handling with 3-attempt retry logic. Fallback for old runs without stage outputs. Safe JSON parsing. Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear separation of concerns. Type safety throughout. Code comments reference Story 10.7 for traceability. Consistent with existing Epic 8 patterns."
