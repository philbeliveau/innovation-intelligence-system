nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clerk authentication properly enforced. User isolation working via Prisma userId queries. Optional improvement: add rate limiting for /api/runs endpoint."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "10-second polling interval appropriate for real-time updates. Conditional polling prevents unnecessary API calls when not on pipeline viewer. Database queries optimized with Prisma."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling with retry mechanism implemented. Loading skeletons prevent UI flicker. Database persistence ensures data reliability."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Custom useRuns hook properly abstracts API logic. Test coverage enables safe refactoring. Code follows Next.js 15 best practices."
  usability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear status indicators with animated spinner. Disclaimer tooltip addresses status tracking expectations. Responsive design works on all devices."
  accessibility:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Proper button elements. Semantic HTML. Status conveyed via text and icons (not color alone). Tooltip accessible via hover."
