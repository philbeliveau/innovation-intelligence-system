# Opportunity Quality Scoring Rubric

## Purpose
This rubric provides a standardized framework for evaluating the quality of innovation opportunities generated by the Innovation Intelligence System. Each opportunity is scored across four critical dimensions to assess whether outputs justify customer payment and meet business viability standards.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Novelty (1-5)
**Definition:** Is this a fresh, innovative idea or is it obvious/generic?

**Scoring Guide:**

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **5 - Breakthrough** | Highly original idea that challenges industry norms; unlikely to be found elsewhere | Cross-industry inspiration that creates new market category; biomimicry-based solution no one has tried |
| **4 - Innovative** | Fresh perspective with unique elements; differentiated from common approaches | Existing concept applied in novel way for this industry; unexpected combination of trends |
| **3 - Moderately Novel** | Some original elements but somewhat predictable; industry peers might be exploring similar ideas | Trend-based opportunity with brand-specific twist; incremental innovation on existing category |
| **2 - Derivative** | Largely predictable; follows obvious industry trends without unique angle | Generic sustainability play; standard digital transformation initiative |
| **1 - Obvious** | Completely generic; could apply to any brand in the category | "Launch social media campaign"; "Improve customer service"; basic hygiene factors |

**Assessment Question:** Would an innovation team member say "I hadn't thought of that" or "Everyone's doing this"?

---

### 2. Actionability (1-5)
**Definition:** Are next steps concrete and implementable, or too vague to act on?

**Scoring Guide:**

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **5 - Immediately Actionable** | Crystal clear next steps; could start implementation next week with defined resources | Specific partnership target named; exact product formulation described; pilot market identified |
| **4 - Well-Defined** | Clear path forward with minor details to resolve; most implementation questions answered | Partnership type specified but partner TBD; product concept clear but formulation needs R&D |
| **3 - Moderately Actionable** | General direction provided but requires additional scoping; feasibility assessment needed | Broad category opportunity with some implementation hints; needs internal team to develop specs |
| **2 - Vague** | High-level concept only; significant work needed to translate into concrete steps | "Explore partnerships"; "Develop new product line" without specifics |
| **1 - Not Actionable** | No clear next steps; purely conceptual with no implementation guidance | Abstract ideas; philosophical statements without practical application |

**Assessment Question:** Could an innovation team begin working on this opportunity within 2-4 weeks, or would they need months of additional scoping?

---

### 3. Relevance (1-5)
**Definition:** Does this authentically fit the brand's context, capabilities, and strategic positioning?

**Scoring Guide:**

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **5 - Perfect Fit** | Leverages brand's unique strengths; aligns with strategic priorities; feels authentic to brand identity | McCormick spice subscription using flavor expertise; Lactalis leveraging dairy production byproducts |
| **4 - Strong Alignment** | Fits brand capabilities and strategy with minor adjustments; credible brand extension | Decathlon experiential retail using outdoor expertise; Columbia sustainability leveraging supply chain |
| **3 - Moderate Fit** | Within brand's realm but stretches capabilities or positioning; requires justification | Food brand launching tech platform; apparel brand entering services |
| **2 - Weak Fit** | Questionable brand alignment; requires significant capability building or positioning shift | Dairy brand launching extreme sports initiative; spice company entering fashion |
| **1 - Misaligned** | Doesn't fit brand identity, capabilities, or market positioning at all | Technology brand with no connection to brand DNA; contradicts core values |

**Assessment Question:** Would the brand's leadership say "This is us" or "This doesn't feel like our brand"?

---

### 4. Specificity (1-5)
**Definition:** Is this detailed enough to act on, or too vague and generic?

**Scoring Guide:**

| Score | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **5 - Highly Specific** | Rich detail across multiple dimensions; includes target customers, channels, timing, metrics | Named partnerships, specific product features, identified pilot markets, concrete success metrics |
| **4 - Detailed** | Key details provided with clear scope; some specifics may need refinement | Product category defined with features; target audience specified; implementation timeline suggested |
| **3 - Moderately Specific** | General concept with some details; enough to understand but needs more precision | Product type identified but features vague; target market broad; timeline unclear |
| **2 - Generic** | High-level category with minimal details; applies to many similar opportunities | "New product line"; "marketing campaign"; category without differentiation |
| **1 - Completely Vague** | Abstract concept with no concrete details; impossible to differentiate from similar ideas | "Innovation opportunity"; "strategic initiative" without any defining characteristics |

**Assessment Question:** Could two different teams read this and build the same thing, or would interpretations vary wildly?

## Overall Score Calculation

**Overall Score = (Novelty + Actionability + Relevance + Specificity) ÷ 4**

Round to one decimal place (e.g., 3.5, 4.2).

### Quality Thresholds

- **4.0-5.0:** Exceptional - Ready for executive presentation
- **3.5-3.9:** Strong - Minor refinement needed
- **3.0-3.4:** Acceptable - Requires development work
- **2.5-2.9:** Weak - Significant improvement needed
- **<2.5:** Insufficient - Does not meet quality bar

### Target Metrics (from KPI Table)

- **Average Overall Score:** ≥3.5 across all opportunities
- **Quality Pass Rate:** ≥70% of opportunities scoring ≥3.0

## Scoring Process

### Preparation
1. Read the complete opportunity card including description, actionability section, visual, and follow-up prompts
2. Review the source input and brand profile to understand context
3. Have rubric open during scoring for consistent reference

### Scoring Workflow
1. Score each dimension independently (1-5) using the rubric guide
2. Add brief notes justifying each score (1-2 sentences)
3. Calculate overall score (average of 4 dimensions)
4. Document any qualitative observations in notes field

### Best Practices
- **Be Consistent:** Use the same standards across all opportunities
- **Be Honest:** Score objectively, not aspirationally
- **Document Reasoning:** Notes help identify patterns and improvement areas
- **Consider Context:** Novelty and relevance are relative to the brand/industry
- **Think Like a Customer:** Would an innovation team pay $149-$1500/month for this quality?

## Common Scoring Pitfalls

❌ **Halo Effect:** Letting one strong dimension inflate others
❌ **Leniency Bias:** Scoring too generously because "it's not bad"
❌ **Strictness Bias:** Scoring too harshly because "it could be better"
❌ **Central Tendency:** Avoiding extreme scores (1s and 5s) when warranted
❌ **Comparison Bias:** Scoring relative to other opportunities rather than absolute rubric

✅ **Score against the rubric, not against other opportunities**

## Notes Field Guidelines

Capture these elements in the notes field:
- **Strengths:** What makes this opportunity strong?
- **Weaknesses:** What holds it back from higher scores?
- **Context:** Any unique circumstances affecting the score
- **Improvement Ideas:** How could this opportunity be enhanced?

Example note: *"Strong novelty due to biomimicry inspiration (5), but actionability limited by vague partnership suggestions (3). Fits brand perfectly but needs more specific next steps."*

## Validation Questions

After scoring, ask yourself:
1. **Would I pay for this?** If I were a VP of Innovation, would this opportunity justify subscription cost?
2. **Can I act on this?** Could my team start working on this within a month?
3. **Is this unique?** Would I find this insight in standard trend reports?
4. **Is this credible?** Does this authentically fit the brand, or does it feel forced?

If you answer "No" to multiple questions, the overall score should likely be <3.0.
