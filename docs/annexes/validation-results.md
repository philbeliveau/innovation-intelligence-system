## Quality Assessment Methodology

### Assessment Framework

**Quality Rubric Location:** `docs/opportunity-quality-rubric.md`

Four assessment dimensions, each scored 1-5:

1. **Novelty (1-5)**
   - 5: Breakthrough cross-industry insight
   - 4: Strong novelty with fresh perspective
   - 3: Moderate novelty, industry-relevant
   - 2: Limited novelty, somewhat predictable
   - 1: No novelty, standard practice

2. **Actionability (1-5)**
   - 5: Clear next steps with resources/timelines
   - 4: Clear next steps provided
   - 3: General direction with some specifics
   - 2: Vague guidance, lacks specificity
   - 1: No actionable next steps

3. **Relevance (1-5)**
   - 5: Excellent fit for brand strategy
   - 4: Strong fit for brand
   - 3: Moderate fit, requires adaptation
   - 2: Weak fit, brand alignment unclear
   - 1: No fit, misaligned with brand

4. **Specificity (1-5)**
   - 5: Well-detailed concept, ready to prototype
   - 4: Well-detailed concept
   - 3: Adequate detail, needs refinement
   - 2: Requires more specificity
   - 1: Too vague to evaluate

**Overall Score Calculation:** Average of 4 dimensions

**Quality Threshold:** ≥3.0 overall score = "professional quality"

### Sampling Methodology

**Sampling Strategy:** First opportunity from each successful scenario
- **Rationale:** Representative sample of pipeline output quality
- **Sample Size:** 22 opportunities (1 per successful scenario from 24 total)
- **Sampling Rate:** 20% of total opportunities (22 of 110 generated)

**Assessment Process:**
1. Manual review by innovation expert
2. Score each dimension 1-5
3. Calculate overall score (average of 4 dimensions)
4. Document strengths and weaknesses
5. Aggregate scores for statistical analysis
