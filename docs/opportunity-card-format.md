# Opportunity Card Format Specification

## Overview

This document defines the standard format for innovation opportunity cards generated by Stage 5 of the Innovation Intelligence System. Each card represents a brand-specific, actionable innovation opportunity derived from market insights.

## Purpose

## Format Structure

Each opportunity card consists of:
1. **YAML Frontmatter** (metadata)
2. **Title** (concise opportunity name)
3. **Description** (detailed explanation)
4. **Actionability** (concrete next steps)
5. **Visual Placeholder** (suggested visual description)
6. **Follow-up Prompts** (exploration questions)

---

## 1. YAML Frontmatter

YAML frontmatter enables metadata parsing by static site generators and automation tools.

### Required Fields

```yaml
---
opportunity_id: string       # Unique identifier (format: brand-YYYYMMDD-NNN)

---

## 2. Title

**Purpose:** Capture the core opportunity in a memorable, scannable phrase.

### Specifications

- **Length:** 5-10 words
- **Style:** Active, benefit-oriented language
- **Format:** Title case
- **Tone:** Aspirational yet grounded

### Guidelines

✅ **Good Examples:**
- "Transform Sporting Events Into Entertainment Spectacles"
- "Premium Fast-Casual Dining at Traditional Price Points"
- "Mindful Consumption Rituals for Modern Wellness"

❌ **Bad Examples:**
- "New Product Idea" (too vague)
- "Leverage the Savannah Bananas Business Model to Create Immersive Brand Experiences Through Innovative Customer Engagement Strategies" (too long)
- "Do what the Savannah Bananas did" (not brand-contextualized)

---

## 3. Description

**Purpose:** Explain the opportunity, its relevance, and alignment with brand strategy.

### Specifications

- **Length:** 2-3 paragraphs (150-250 words)
- **Structure:**
  1. **Paragraph 1:** What is the opportunity? (innovation summary)
  2. **Paragraph 2:** Why is this relevant now? (market context + brand fit)
  3. **Paragraph 3 (optional):** How does this address brand needs? (strategic alignment)

### Content Guidelines

**Include:**
- Clear description of the innovation concept
- Connection to market trends or insights
- Alignment with brand values and strategy
- Potential impact on target customers
- Differentiation from current approach

**Avoid:**
- Generic marketing language
- Unsupported claims
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Repetition of title content

### Example

```markdown
The Savannah Bananas reimagined baseball by prioritizing entertainment over
traditional sport conventions. Their "Fans First" philosophy transforms every
game into a theatrical experience with choreographed celebrations, audience
participation, and unconventional rules designed for engagement rather than
competitive purity.

For Lactalis Canada, this approach offers a blueprint for transforming routine
dairy consumption into memorable brand experiences. As consumers increasingly
value experiences over products, there's an opportunity to create "Cheese
Tasting Theater" events that combine product education with entertainment,
turning cheese selection from a commodity purchase into a cultural experience.

This aligns with Lactalis' premium positioning and addresses the challenge of
differentiating in a crowded dairy market. By creating shareable, Instagram-
worthy moments around cheese discovery, Lactalis can build emotional connections
with younger consumers while justifying premium pricing through experiential value.

## 4. Actionability

**Purpose:** Provide concrete next steps to move from concept to implementation.

### Specifications

- **Format:** Bulleted list
- **Count:** 3-5 action items
- **Style:** Specific, time-bound when possible
- **Ownership:** Identify responsible function/role

### Action Item Template

```
- [Functional Owner] [Specific Action] [Timeframe/Deliverable]
```

### Guidelines

**Good Action Items:**
- Start with action verb
- Specify deliverable or outcome
- Indicate responsible team/function
- Include success criteria when relevant
- Progress from research → test → scale

**Progressive Complexity:**
1. **Research/Validate** - Low-cost exploration
2. **Pilot/Test** - Small-scale experimentation
3. **Scale/Implement** - Broader rollout (if pilot succeeds)

### Example

```markdown
## Actionability

- **Marketing Team:** Conduct 3-5 customer interviews with millennials/Gen Z to
  validate interest in experiential cheese events (2 weeks)
- **Product Team:** Design pilot "Cheese Tasting Theater" event concept with
  entertainment elements, partner with local venue (4 weeks)
- **Brand Strategy:** Benchmark competitor experiential marketing initiatives
  and calculate ROI model for event-based brand building (3 weeks)
- **Digital Team:** Create social media content strategy for event amplification,
  including influencer partnership opportunities (2 weeks)

  traditional advertising (3 weeks)
```

## 5. Visual Placeholder

**Purpose:** Suggest imagery that would bring the opportunity to life.

### Specifications

### Guidelines

### Example

```markdown
## Visual

*Imagine a dimly lit venue with a small stage, where a charismatic host theatrically
presents artisan cheeses like a sommelier unveils rare wines. The audience—young
professionals holding tasting paddles—laughs as they participate in a "cheese
challenge" game. Lactalis branding appears subtly on elegant tasting cards and
glassware, with warm lighting creating an intimate, upscale atmosphere.*
```

## 6. Follow-up Prompts

### Prompt Categories

**Types of prompts:**
1. **Validation Questions** - Test assumptions and feasibility
2. **Expansion Questions** - Explore variations and extensions
3. **Challenge Questions** - Identify obstacles and risks

### Guidelines

**Good Prompts:**
- Start with "How might we..."
- Challenge assumptions constructively
- Explore edge cases or constraints
- Connect to adjacent opportunities
- Invite creative problem-solving

### Example

```markdown
## Follow-up Prompts

1. **Validation:** How might we test whether millennials and Gen Z consumers
   perceive experiential cheese events as premium vs. gimmicky, and what signals
   would indicate authentic engagement vs. novelty-seeking?

2. **Expansion:** What other "routine consumption categories" (yogurt, butter,
   milk) could benefit from the experiential approach, and how would the
   entertainment format differ for each category?

3. **Challenge:** How might we overcome the constraint that cheese experiences
   don't scale like digital marketing, and what hybrid physical-digital formats
   could amplify reach while preserving experiential value?
