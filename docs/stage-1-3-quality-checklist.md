# Stages 1-3 Quality Review Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides manual quality assessment criteria for Stages 1-3 pipeline outputs. Use this to evaluate whether the pipeline produces high-quality, actionable insights suitable for brand contextualization (Stage 4) and opportunity generation (Stage 5).

**Quality Target:** 4 out of 6 inputs (67%) should achieve "Good Quality" rating

## Scoring Methodology

Each stage is scored independently using a 3-point scale:

- **Good Quality (2 points):** Meets all core quality criteria
- **Acceptable Quality (1 point):** Meets most criteria with minor issues
- **Poor Quality (0 points):** Fails to meet core quality criteria

**Overall Input Rating:**
- **Pass:** 5-6 points across all three stages (average ≥ 1.67 per stage)
- **Marginal:** 3-4 points (needs improvement)
- **Fail:** 0-2 points (significant issues)

## Stage 1: Input Processing and Inspiration Identification

**Core Purpose:** Extract 3-5 specific, actionable inspiration elements from input document

### Quality Criteria

#### ✅ Specificity and Concreteness
- [ ] Inspirations reference specific elements from source document (not vague generalizations)
- [ ] Each inspiration includes concrete details (e.g., specific tactics, mechanisms, examples)
- [ ] Inspirations avoid generic statements like "they innovated" or "they were creative"

**Good Example:**
> "The Savannah Bananas created 'Banana Ball' with rules like a 2-hour time limit, fans catching foul balls for outs, and post-hit showdowns replacing extra innings—transforming baseball into fast-paced entertainment."

**Poor Example:**
> "The company innovated in their industry by being creative and customer-focused."

#### ✅ Actionability
- [ ] Each inspiration suggests a clear mechanism or approach that could be adapted
- [ ] Inspirations focus on "how they did it" not just "what they did"
- [ ] Inspirations are practical enough to inform strategy (not purely descriptive)

**Good Example:**
> "Mars Petcare partnered with People Magazine to create a new cultural category (Sexiest Cat Dad Alive), legitimizing male cat ownership through mainstream media validation."

**Poor Example:**
> "The brand was successful in their marketing campaign."

#### ✅ Distinctiveness
- [ ] 3-5 inspirations are identified (not too few or too many)
- [ ] Each inspiration is distinct (not repetitive or overlapping)
- [ ] Inspirations cover different aspects of the source innovation

#### ✅ Grounding in Source Document
- [ ] All inspirations can be traced back to specific content in input document
- [ ] No hallucinated elements or external knowledge injected
- [ ] Inspirations accurately represent the source material

### Stage 1 Scoring

**Quality Rating:** [ ] Good (2) | [ ] Acceptable (1) | [ ] Poor (0)

**Notes:**
```
[Document specific findings, issues, or strong points]
```

## Stage 2: Signal Amplification and Trend Extraction

**Core Purpose:** Identify 3-5 underlying trends/patterns from Stage 1 inspirations without external research

### Quality Criteria

#### ✅ Document-Derived (No Hallucination)
- [ ] All trends can be traced to specific inspirations from Stage 1
- [ ] No introduction of external trends, research, or market data
- [ ] Trends are inferred from document patterns, not generic industry knowledge

**Good Example:**
> "From the Savannah Bananas' Banana Ball rules and TikTok-first content: **Trend toward entertainment-first formats** - Rules designed for spectacle over tradition (2-hour limit, foul ball outs, no bunting)"

**Poor Example:**
> "Gen Z consumers prefer authentic brands and sustainability, as shown by recent market research." *(This introduces external data not from the document)*

#### ✅ Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Trends identify underlying patterns or mechanisms (not just restating inspirations)
- [ ] Trends show "why this works" or "what need this addresses"
- [ ] Trends connect multiple inspirations when appropriate

**Good Example:**
> "**Trend: Format innovation as competitive advantage** - The Bananas didn't improve baseball; they created a new category (Banana Ball) that removes direct comparison to traditional baseball"

**Poor Example:**
> "The Bananas are popular." *(No pattern or mechanism identified)*

#### ✅ Abstraction Level
- [ ] Trends are more abstract than inspirations (one level up from specific tactics)
- [ ] Trends are not yet universal (still tied to source domain/industry)
- [ ] Trends bridge between specific inspirations (Stage 1) and universal lessons (Stage 3)

#### ✅ Analytical Depth
- [ ] 3-5 trends identified (comprehensive but not exhaustive)
- [ ] Trends provide insight into "what's changing" or "what's working"
- [ ] Each trend includes supporting evidence from inspirations

#### ✅ Accuracy and Integrity
- [ ] No misrepresentation of source inspirations
- [ ] No over-interpretation or speculative claims
- [ ] Trends are defensible based on Stage 1 output

### Stage 2 Scoring

**Quality Rating:** [ ] Good (2) | [ ] Acceptable (1) | [ ] Poor (0)

**Notes:**
```
[Document specific findings, issues, or strong points]
```

## Stage 3: General Translation to Universal Lessons

**Core Purpose:** Synthesize Stage 1 and Stage 2 into 3-5 universal, brand-agnostic principles applicable across industries

### Quality Criteria

#### ✅ True Universality (De-contextualized)
- [ ] Lessons completely remove industry/domain context
- [ ] No references to source industry (e.g., sports, food, fashion)
- [ ] Lessons are equally applicable to any industry

**Good Example:**
> "**Universal Lesson: Create proprietary formats that redefine success metrics**
> When competitors optimize for established benchmarks, design a new format with different rules that makes you incomparable. Your constraints become features."

**Poor Example:**
> "Sports teams should focus on entertainment value." *(Still domain-specific)*

#### ✅ Actionable Principles
- [ ] Each lesson provides a clear strategic principle
- [ ] Lessons suggest "how to think" not just "what to do"
- [ ] Lessons are practical enough to guide innovation strategy

**Good Example:**
> "**Universal Lesson: Partner with cultural authorities to legitimize emerging behaviors**
> When addressing social stigma or emerging trends, collaborate with mainstream institutions to provide validation and accelerate normalization."

**Poor Example:**
> "Innovation is important for success." *(Too vague to be actionable)*

#### ✅ Synthesis Quality
- [ ] Lessons synthesize multiple inspirations and trends (not just restatements)
- [ ] Lessons identify deeper strategic patterns
- [ ] 3-5 lessons provide comprehensive coverage without redundancy

#### ✅ Strategic Value
- [ ] Lessons offer non-obvious insights (not common knowledge)
- [ ] Lessons could inform brand strategy or innovation decisions
- [ ] Lessons are memorable and distinctive

#### ✅ Structural Clarity
- [ ] Each lesson has a clear title/summary
- [ ] Lessons include explanation of the principle
- [ ] Lessons maintain connection to source inspirations without domain references

### Stage 3 Scoring

**Quality Rating:** [ ] Good (2) | [ ] Acceptable (1) | [ ] Poor (0)

**Notes:**
```
[Document specific findings, issues, or strong points]
