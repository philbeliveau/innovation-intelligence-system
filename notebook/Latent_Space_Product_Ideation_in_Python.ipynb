        "This Google Colab notebook implements a powerful **latent space ideation framework** that combines the strengths of modern language models and swarm intelligence.

        "* **Decodes ideas back to human language** using a large generative language model (e.g., `google/gemma-2b-it`)\n",
        "* **Scores and ranks ideas** with a placeholder evaluator (easily replaceable with an LLM-based judge)\n",
