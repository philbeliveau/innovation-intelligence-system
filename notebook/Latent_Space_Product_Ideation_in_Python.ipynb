        "\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook implements a powerful **latent space ideation framework** that combines the strengths of modern language models and swarm intelligence. It allows users to **generate novel, high-quality ideas** by navigating and manipulating embedding spaces using a custom-built Swarm Queen Optimization (SQO) mechanism.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔍 What This Notebook Does\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encodes ideas into embeddings** using `sentence-transformers`\n",
        "* **Explores latent space** via a swarm of intelligent agents guided by a central \"Swarm Queen\"\n",
        "* **Interpolates and mutates concepts** in vector space to spark new innovations\n",
        "* **Decodes ideas back to human language** using a large generative language model (e.g., `google/gemma-2b-it`)\n",
        "* **Scores and ranks ideas** with a placeholder evaluator (easily replaceable with an LLM-based judge)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🧠 Key Components\n",
        "\n",
