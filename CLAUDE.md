# Innovation Intelligence System - Claude Configuration

Project Context: CPG Innovation Intelligence Tool (Working Title)
Status: Early validation phase. Problem definition in progress.
Core Premise (Unvalidated):
Innovation teams at large CPG companies (P&G, Unilever, etc.) struggle to convert market signals (trend reports, competitor launches, startup activity) into actionable, brand-specific innovation opportunities. Current tools provide data but don't help translate insights into their specific context or build internal conviction around ideas.
Proposed Solution Architecture:
The engine generates brand-specific innovation opportunities (5-10 ideas delivered on a regular cadence‚Äîfrequency TBD). These are "freshly baked" ideas, not raw data dumps.
Optional Elicitation Layer:
Users can choose to engage in guided elicitation conversations with AI to refine, stress-test, and deepen any idea they find promising. This is not mandatory‚Äîit's an on-demand feature for users who want to take an idea to the next level and build stronger internal conviction/ownership. The elicitation uses questioning techniques to help them adapt the idea to their specific context, identify obstacles, and strengthen their business case.
Target Buyer (Hypothesis):
Innovation teams at large CPG companies. Specific titles, team structures, and decision-making processes still being mapped.
Key Metric (Hypothesis):
Enable teams to process 3x more opportunities with the same headcount‚Äîthough whether "more opportunities" is actually their constraint is unproven.
Critical Open Questions:

Is the problem volume (not enough ideas), quality (too many bad ideas), speed (too slow), translation (can't contextualize), or conviction (can't get buy-in)?
What makes a "freshly baked idea" valuable vs. just another trend report summary? What's the right level of specificity?
Does optional elicitation actually add value, or will users ignore it? (Testing via workshop)
What data sources power the engine, and what signal gaps must we fill that existing tools don't provide?
Why won't they just build this internally once we prove the concept?
What's the minimum viable improvement that makes this worth paying for?

Current Validation Plan:

Run elicitation workshop with control/test groups to validate methodology
Map actual workflow and data sources of target innovation teams
Identify defensible moat beyond prompt engineering
