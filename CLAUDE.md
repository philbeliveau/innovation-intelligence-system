# Innovation Intelligence System - Claude Configuration
      340 +  ## Deployment to Railway
       341 +  
       342 +  ### Backend Deployment
       343 +  
       344 +  The Python FastAPI backend is deployed to Railway. The service is configured with:
       345 +  - **Root Directory**: `backend` (configured in Railway dashboard)
       346 +  - **Build**: Dockerfile-based build
       347 +  - **Start Command**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
       348 +  
       349 +  **Deploying from CLI:**
       350 +  
       351 +  ```bash
       352 +  # Deploy from PROJECT ROOT (not from backend directory)
       353 +  # Railway is configured with root directory as 'backend'
       354 +  railway deploy
       355 +  
       356 +  # Or using Railway MCP tool
       357 +  # Must provide absolute path to PROJECT ROOT
       358 +  /Users/your-username/path/to/innovation-intelligence-system
       359 +  ```
       360 +  
       361 +  **Important Notes:**
       362 +  - ‚úÖ Deploy from the **project root** directory (`innovation-intelligence-system/`)
       363 +  - ‚ùå Do NOT deploy from `backend/` subdirectory
       364 +  - The Railway service has `backend` configured as the root directory in the dashboard
       365 +  - This means Railway expects to find the `backend/` folder relative to where you deploy from
       366 +  
       367 +  **Environment Variables:**
       368 +  - Set in Railway dashboard under Settings ‚Üí Variables
       369 +  - Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `VERCEL_BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`
       370 +  
       371 +  **Monitoring Deployment:**
       372 +  - Build logs are available in Railway dashboard
       373 +  - Or access via CLI: `railway logs`
## Current Sprint: Pipeline Visualization Frontend Build

**Status:** Building the Pipeline Visualization Page (`/pipeline/[runId]`) with 4 progressive UI states

**Goal:** Transform the existing pipeline page into a live, real-time UI that visualizes all 5 pipeline stages and displays final Opportunity Cards

## Architecture Overview

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15 App Router with TypeScript
- shadcn/ui component library
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Python backend pipeline (5 stages)
- File-based state (no database)

**Key Directories:**
- `innovation-web/` - Next.js frontend application
- `innovation-web/app/pipeline/[runId]/page.tsx` - Main pipeline page to refactor
- `innovation-web/components/pipeline/` - Pipeline-related components
- `docs/front-end-spec.md` - Complete UX/UI specification
- `backend/pipeline/` - Python pipeline implementation

## Frontend Build Task: Pipeline Visualization Page

### Overview
The pipeline page exists as **a single component with 4 progressive states** that evolve as the backend pipeline executes:

**State 1: Stage 1 Running**
- Left box: Extraction animation (beaker/flask visual)
- Right box: Workflow illustration

**State 2: Stage 1 Complete + Stages 2-5 Running**
- Left box: Extracted mechanisms cards with PDF download
- Right box: Stages 2-5 animation with progress indicators

**State 3: All Complete - Opportunity Cards Grid**
- 2-column grid of opportunity cards
- Download All and New Pipeline buttons

**State 4: Card Detail View**
- Collapsed sidebar (thumbnails)
- Expanded opportunity detail with full markdown

### Current Implementation Status

**Existing (`innovation-web/app/pipeline/[runId]/page.tsx`):**
- ‚úÖ Real-time polling with exponential backoff
- ‚úÖ Left sidebar with stage boxes
- ‚úÖ Main content area with basic visualization
- ‚ùå Auto-redirects to `/results/[runId]` (needs removal)
- ‚ùå `DetailPanel` component (needs replacement with state machine)

### Major Changes Required

1. **Delete:** Auto-redirect to `/results/[runId]`
2. **Replace:** `DetailPanel` ‚Üí `PipelineStateMachine` component
3. **Create:** 10 new components for the 4 states
4. **Enhance:** Stage 1 JSON output to include mechanism details
5. **Update:** API status endpoint with timestamps

### New Components to Create

```
innovation-web/components/pipeline/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PipelineStateMachine.tsx       (Orchestrator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExtractionAnimation.tsx        (State 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WorkflowIllustration.tsx       (State 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ExtractedTextView.tsx          (State 2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MechanismCard.tsx              (State 2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StagesAnimation.tsx            (State 2)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityCardsGrid.tsx       (State 3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ OpportunityCard.tsx            (State 3)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CollapsedSidebar.tsx           (State 4)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ExpandedOpportunityDetail.tsx  (State 4)
```

### Key Technical Details

**State Management:**
- React hooks + local state (no Redux)
- State transitions driven by `currentStage` and `status`
- Polling continues until pipeline complete

**API Integration:**
- Poll `GET /api/status/[runId]` every 5 seconds
- Fetch opportunities when `status === 'completed' && currentStage === 5`
- Download endpoints for PDFs

**Visual Design:**
- Color: Teal (#5B9A99 primary)
- Typography: System UI font stack
- Animations: 300-800ms transitions with `ease-in-out`
- Responsive: Mobile (1 col) ‚Üí Tablet (2 col) ‚Üí Desktop (2 col)
